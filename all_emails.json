None of the other utilities had associated charges. We would\r\nlike to see the breakdown for the new charges, similar to the one just\r\nmentioned. Which utilities are being  charged and how are you able to\r\ndistinguish among the usage for each unit?\r\n\r\nIn the addendum it says that \"if Tenant individually or collectively\r\nconserves utilities, any resulting reduction in the utility costs must be\r\npassed on directly to the Tenant\"? Is this the case and how are you able to\r\ntrack this?\r\n\r\nAnother question that we have is regarding the 8% rent increase for the new\r\ntenant. Our departing roommate, Amanda, had been paying $600 for her room.\r\nAmanda's parents live in Berkeley and she spent her weekends at home, so we\r\ndecided to adjust our contributions accordingly. Although we each pay $775\r\nper month through collab (we initially thought this is how we were required\r\nto do it), in actuality we reimburse her every month. After all\r\nconsiderations, the breakdown is:  $833.33 - $833.33 - $833.33 - $600 for a\r\ncombined total of $3100. We are requesting for the 8% increase to be\r\napplied to the amount Amanda was actually paying.\r\n\r\nOnce we get these questions clarified, we will sign the lease.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nIris\r\n\r\nOn Fri, Apr 7, 2023 at 9:51\u202fAM Leasing - Berkeley, CA CollabHome <\r\nberkeley.ca.leasing@collabhome.io> wrote:\r\n\r\n> Hi Iris,\r\n>\r\n> The utility passthrough covers the actual costs of all the utilities paid\r\n> by the landlord, which includes water, electricity and gas for common\r\n> areas, and garbage.

Pay the first month utilities up front.\r\nWe did all three yesterday and funds cleared our account.\r\n\r\nThe lease terms clearly state these are move in terms.\r\n\r\nWe agreed to pay the remaking balance up front prior to move in (7/14/23 is\r\nprior to move in). Therefore, we plan to do that for the other 11 months of\r\nthe contracted lease.\r\n\r\nBryn has asked to view the property as much as she can and has not been\r\naccommodated as yet. I asked as well prior to signing the lease.\r\n\r\nNow we have paid what was asked and executed the contract - only to be\r\nasked for the other amount at this time with no willingness to show her the\r\nproperty.\r\nWe are understandably concerned about this matter given our good faith\r\neffort to provide what was asked of us in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nPlease contact us to let us know that she can see the property today or\r\ntomorrow.

I signed a 12-month lease\r\nextension in March this year. However, we recently got to know that my wife\r\nis pregnant and we will be expanding our family size to 4 members by the\r\nend of this year or early next year.

Landlord team can\r\nbenefit from an increased market rate versus my rent which is the same as\r\nlast year. I get detached after the month end 07/2023.\r\n\r\n(2) I continue my signed lease extension but sub-lease my unit to a new\r\ntenant for the period 08/2023 to 05/2024. We can discuss how the landlord\r\ncan directly collect rental from the new sub-lessee directly. I move out on\r\n08/2023 but settle my lease on 05/2024. Landlord will not get the market\r\nrent increase under this case.\r\n\r\nI am okay with any of the above proposals.

And I've already emailed the payment proof\r\nfrom my bank to Collab Accounting team payment@collabcommunity.io on April\r\n1st. It's a legit method that has been validated by both the property owner\r\nMr. Qian Wang and the Collab person who's in charge of such matter-- Ms.\r\nAnnie Hui.

Thank you for your time.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\nArvind\r\n\r\nOn Thu, Mar 16, 2023 at 7:35\u202fPM Leasing - Berkeley, CA CollabHome <\r\nberkeley.ca.leasing@collabhome.io> wrote:\r\n\r\n> Hi Arvind,\r\n> Thanks for your interest in Durant 3.

I know you mentioned they could add a 3rd roommate in the future should they choose, and the listing states subletting is permitted, but the rental agreement was contradictory on this.

Your application has been approved for 2423 Durant Ave Unit B, . We will send the lease agreement to all applicants and guarantors (if any) for e-signature via Dropbox Sign.\r\n\r\nTo secure the unit, the lease agreement must be signed and the move-in payment must be paid within 48 hours from the time you receive your lease agreement.

We\r\nare very interested in signing the lease, but we are not willing to sign it\r\nbefore we see an in person showing of the unit. Like what was stated on the\r\nphone call, there must be a 24 hr notice to the tenant before the showing,\r\nand like what was stated on the lease, we have 48 hrs to sign the agreement\r\nuntil the next applicant is approved. We would like to do a showing on\r\nWednesday, 3/22 anytime from 8am-1pm, which would be during \"normal\r\nbusiness hours,\" according to California law requiring showings to be in\r\nsuch time, in order to get the lease signed on time. If this is not\r\npossible, we request to extend the lease signing period until we are able\r\nto have a showing of the place.\r\n\r\nAlso, on the lease papers was the \u201cMove-In Initial Inspection Form,\u201d where\r\nit was expected that we initial it. Because this is meant to be done by\r\ninspecting a vacated unit, we would not initial this form until move in.\r\n\r\nIn addition, on the lease signing contract, we also noticed that subleasing\r\nis not allowed, which was not what was listed on the website.

In the\r\nemail, it stated *\"If you confirm that you will renew your lease by next\r\nFriday, March 3rd, 2023, we will NOT increase your rent.\"* Given this email\r\nand my intention to renew my lease, *I emailed\r\nberkeley.ca.leasing@collabhome.io <berkeley.ca.leasing@collabhome.io> on\r\nFebruary 24th at 4:28PM,* well before the March 3rd deadline.\r\n\r\nOn February 28th, I received another email from CollabHome, instructing me\r\nto complete a Google Form to confirm my rent renewal for Apartment 16.\r\nAgain, the instructions in the email stated* \"If you submit the above\r\nGoogle Form by this Saturday, March 4th, 2023, we will NOT increase your\r\nrent.\" I completed and submitted the form on February 28th at\r\n10:09PM.* Additionally,\r\nthere was *no* information on the google form stating the terms of a rent\r\nincrease. I also spoke to Aileen on Friday, March 10th and confirmed my\r\nlease renewal situation with her. In this meeting, there was, again, no\r\nclear indication that I will be receiving an increase in rent.\r\n\r\nYesterday, on March 14th at 11:29PM, Aileen messaged me on Discord, asking\r\nme if I could confirm my lease renewal at *$3,060*. This was the *FIRST*\r\ntime I received a message about a rent increase.\r\n\r\nMy current rent price is* $2,750. *The new $3,060 rent price that Aileen\r\ninformed me of, is an *11.3% increase in my rent price. *I was not given\r\ntimely written notice of this sufficient increase in my rent. Based on my\r\nrental experience in the past, I was always given 90 days notice of any\r\nincreases in rent. Additionally, it was clearly stated in numerous emails\r\nthat roommate switches were allowed and the Berkeley Rent Board also states\r\nthat Landlords must allow original tenants to replace roommates who have\r\nleft. This rent increase and lack of timely notice has caused distress to\r\nme and my new co-tenant.\r\n\r\nI am a good tenant, who respects neighbors and always pays rent on time. I\r\nenjoy the CollabHome property and believe in its mission. Please let me\r\nknow how we can come to a solution for this issue and ensure Apartment 16\r\nat 2521 Regent St is secured.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJackie\r\n--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJackie Nguyen (she/her/hers)\r\n\r\nUniversity of California, Berkeley | Class of 2024\r\n\r\n(916) 517-0374 | jackienguyen@berkeley.edu\r\n", "\r\n<https://voice.google.com>\r\nHello Leasing - Berkeley, CA CollabHome,\r\n\r\nYou missed a call from (443) 214-8485.\r\nTo avoid missing calls on the web, keep Google Voice\r\n<https://voice.google.com> open in your browser.\r\ncall back\r\n<https://voice.google.com/calls?a=nc,%2B14432148485&e=berkeley.ca.leasing@collabhome.io&source=callback_email>\r\nYOUR ACCOUNT <https://voice.google.com> HELP CENTER\r\n<https://support.google.com/voice#topic=1707989> HELP FORUM\r\n<https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/voice>\r\nThis email was sent to you because you indicated that you'd like to receive\r\nemail notifications for missed calls.
