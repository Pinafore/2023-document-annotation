        We are developing an AI-assisted tool to help humans label a collection of text passages with  
        themes of interest. For this study, you will be shown passages from a collection of documents in
        English, alongside other information such as the title of the document they come from, and/or 
        top keywords that characterize the theme of the passage. An example is given below. You will 
        then be asked to come up with a suitable label for the passages shown, either by creating a new
        label or selecting one of the labels that you have already created. Over time, you will get 
        recommendations for which label might best fit a passage according to your prior work, which 
        you can approve or edit to a more appropriate label. You will be able to view the progress of 
        your work at any time and can modify labels you have created or labels you have assigned to 
        any passage.  
        Example instance for your task - 
        Document Title: Plan Alignment
        Top Topic Words: plan, implementation, local, changes, progress, process, data, 
        measures, time, monitoring
        Passage: “There is no perfect science. Develop an adaptive process that allows 
        modification as science advances." 
        oYou can either create a New Label (enter free-form text) or select a label out of 
        the ones that you have previously created during the annotation session from a 
        drop-down menu as the label for the passage.
        The total length of the task will not exceed one hour, and the majority of your time will be spent 
        looking at passages and accompanying information in order to annotate passages with labels 
        you create. Please note that for our purposes the quality of labels is just important as efficiency: 
        please take time to think of what you think are labels that do a good job of summarizing each 
        passage. The number of passages is chosen in a way that makes it possible to annotate all of 
        them in the passages time. If you complete the hour-long session following the instructions will 
        receive $20 as compensation. Any suspected fraud or abuse will result in forfeiture of 
        compensation, and that includes not actually completing the task (more than 5 instances left 
        unlabeled). 
        We will not ask you for any personally identifying information and the annotations will never 
        require any de-anonymizing information from you whatsoever. 
        You must be at least 18 years old in order to participate in this task. If you have questions, 
        concerns, or complaints, or if you need to report an injury related to the research, please contact
