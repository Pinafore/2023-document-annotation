      <p>
        We are developing an AI-assisted tool to help humans label a collection
        of text passages with themes of interest. For this study, you will be
        shown passages from a collection of documents in English, alongside
        other information such as the title of the document they come from,
        and/or top keywords that characterize the theme of the passage. An
        example is given below. You will then be asked to come up with a
        suitable label for the passages shown, either by creating a new label or
        selecting one of the labels that you have already created. Over time,
        you will get recommendations for which label might best fit a passage
        according to your prior work, which you can approve or edit to a more
        appropriate label. You will be able to view the progress of your work at
        any time and can modify labels you have created or labels you have
        assigned to any passage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example instance for your task -
        <li>Document Title: Plan Alignment</li>
        <li>
          Top Topic Words: plan, implementation, local, changes, progress,
          process, data, measures, time, monitoring
        </li>
        <li>
          Passage: “There is no perfect science. Develop an adaptive process
          that allows modification as science advances."
        </li>
      </p>
      <section>
        You can either create a New Label (enter free-form text) or select a
        label out of the ones that you have previously created during the
        annotation session from a drop-down menu as the label for the passage.
      </section>

      <p>
        The total length of the task will not exceed one hour, and the majority
        of your time will be spent looking at passages and accompanying
        information in order to annotate passages with labels you create. Please
        note that for our purposes the quality of labels is just important as
        efficiency: please take time to think of what you think are labels that
        do a good job of summarizing each passage. The number of passages is
        chosen in a way that makes it possible to annotate all of them in the
        passages time.
      </p>
      If you complete the hour-long session following the instructions will
      receive $20 as compensation.<br />
      Any suspected fraud or abuse will result in forfeiture of compensation,
      and that includes not actually completing the task (more than 5 instances
      left unlabeled).<br />
      We will not ask you for any personally identifying information and the
      annotations will never require any de-anonymizing information from you
      whatsoever. You must be at least 18 years old in order to participate in
      this task. If you have questions, concerns, or complaints, or if you need
      to report an injury related to the research, please contact the
      investigator: <br />
