This methodology is appropriate for any type of place-based  planningincluding hazard mitigation. However, the Workbook was designed with environmental professionals who manage  watersheds or coastal places and protect the health of aquatic  ecosystems as its main audience. This Workbook assumes that  users:   represent an organization that has environmental goals or  objectives;  start with some sense that climate change will pose a threat  to what their organization is trying to accomplish;  are comfortable using science to inform decision-making; and  have sufficient knowledge of their environmental system (or can partner with those who do) to  understand how climate changes may affect the way it functions.", "54": "Risk Management A risk management process helps with decision-making when organizations are faced with uncertainty  about whether they will be able to meet their goals. Risk management guides an organization to help  it determine what risks are important and need to be addressed. The process encourages a broad  look at all potential risks to an organizations goals. The process is systematic and builds on information  generated in previous steps, allows for judgments and decisions, and allows users to incorporate new  data and information as they become available.  Begin sidebar elaboration defining how the word organization is used in this workbook.  Organization ISO 31000 can be used by any  public, private or community  enterprise, association, group or  individual (p. 1). The Workbook,  like the standard it is based on,  uses the term organization to  refer to any user. End of Sidebar 2  FEMAs Mitigation Planning How-To Guide # 1 (FEMA 386-1), Introduction Table 1, describes a very similar process for hazard  mitigation planning.BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 7 Introduction and How to Use This Workbook Risk management is a flexible process. How it is  implemented depends on the organization and  the purpose for which it is used. Sometimes, when  people initially hear that they will be participating  in a risk management process, they misperceive  what that will mean. Risk management can be a  lengthy, demanding process. It often entails  laboratory analysis, extensive use of statistical  analysis, and other difficult, costly or time- consuming steps. However, when there is no  direct, imminent threat to health or safety or a  planning-level assessment is acceptable, then less  intensive approaches to risk management can be  appropriate. The identified risk management  framework can be used for chemical exposure,  engineering decisions or global climate change,  but how each step is executed or what types of  conclusions can be reached may be different.  Risk management is about your organization: your  goals and objectives, your context, your priorities,  your decisions on how to respond. Systematically  working through your situation with a risk  management framework will help you:  find risks that you might have overlooked  and avoid surprises;  assess risks differently than you otherwise  would have;  find strategies that can address more than one risk and increase efficiency;  make better decisions; and  increase the odds that you will be able to reach your goals. You will also have a reference to why you think something is important and needs attention as well as a  communication tool that allows others to understand system challenges. The ISO 31000Risk Management methodology is the  foundation of this Workbook. Here, the start-to-finish procedure  described in the standard is divided into two halves to be  consistent with the community of practice for climate change  adaptation (Figure I-1). Part 1 is referred to as a vulnerability  assessment (which in the Workbooks methodology can be a  stand-alone product); Part 2 is an action plan. Part 2 also includes  implementation of the action plan", "55": "Vulnerability Assessments A vulnerability assessment is an understanding of how climate change will uniquely affect your  organization. The organization is the center of attention, and the reasons why it exists (i.e., its purpose,  mission, goals or objectives) are the base units of the vulnerability assessment.  Organizational goals are the focus of concern. Goals are why organizations exist and what motivates  them; goals provide a context for changes. The vulnerability assessment half of a risk-based adaptation  plan is different from a climate change impacts study that describes how the future will be different if  the climate is different. An impact that is identified without reference to a goal is just a detail. There is no  context to say it is good or bad or that something should be done about it or not. Context comes from  people or organizations. They can say that an impact will help, hurt or have no effect on what they are  trying to do (Table I-1). If impacts will be unwanted, goals might still be attainable if risk-reducing actions  can be implemented. ", "56": "The Workbook has five steps that lead to a climate change vulnerability assessment:  Step 1Communication and Consultation Informing key people about the vulnerability assessment and asking for input.  Step 2Establishing the Context for the Vulnerability Assessment Identifying organizational goals that are susceptible to climate change.  Step 3Risk Identification Brainstorming about how climate stressors will interact with your goals.  Step 4Risk Analysis Developing an initial characterization of consequence and likelihood for each risk.  Step 5Risk Evaluation: Comparing Risks  Using a consequence/probability matrix to build consensus about each risk.", "57": "The Workbook has five steps that lead to a climate change vulnerability assessment:  Step 1Communication and Consultation Informing key people about the vulnerability assessment and asking for input.

Step 4Risk Analysis Developing an initial characterization of consequence and likelihood for each risk.  Step 5Risk Evaluation: Comparing Risks  Using a consequence/probability matrix to build consensus about each risk. A vulnerability assessment represents a step forward, not an end in itself. However, the Workbook treats  a vulnerability assessment as a potential stand-alone product. A vulnerability assessment is a precursor  to an action plan, but it will have value on its own for communication, coordination and decision support.  A vulnerability assessment is a product to be used with your board of directors, senior management, and  peer organizations, and with other levels of government. It is helpful for working with others to obtain  funding, resources, buy-in or approval. Additionally, a broad look at all potential problems allows others  to scan across places, compare neighboring systems, and find partners for addressing common risks.  A vulnerability assessment is also a tool that will help you answer a series of questions about risks and  mitigating options that you will need to ask when preparing your action plan. While it is not necessary to have a stand-alone vulnerability assessment, there can be benefits to pausing  after the assessment becomes available. Time to let the vulnerability assessment findings sink in may be  useful. Pausing also provides an opportunity for consensus building before an action plan is developed.  It is also a time to speak to potential partners about collaborating or dividing up tasks. A response that  will effectively mitigate some risks to tolerable levels could be very expensive or politically sensitive.  Securing resources that can be applied to climate change problems can also take time. Further, some  risks might not start to cause problems for several more decades. For these reasons completing a  vulnerability assessment could mark a temporary break in the adaptation process.  This is a risk management process for climate change. Taking a few days, weeks or months before  launching into the action planning process could be useful. However, if there is no strategy to use an  interim period or if the benefits of pausing are small, keep going with the action planning steps.", "58": "Action Plans An action plan is a document that explains how you will manage your climate change risks. After  completing a vulnerability assessment, you will have identified the risks that have the highest potential to  affect your organizations ability to meet its goals.  The vulnerability assessment process helped you decide which risks to focus on. Now you will identify  actions that might help to decrease those risks and increase the sustainability of your system. Making  these decisions when you have limited resources and probably cannot mitigate all of your risks will not  be easy. Pursuing win-win solutions or no-regrets actions will be appealing options that make sense  regardless of what the future brings.

Involving others will pay off in many ways as you develop your adaptation plan. You will learn what  topics potential partners are concerned about, who can contribute expertise, and whether you have  support for moving forward. The process described in this Workbook is well suited for a collaborative  approach where key stakeholders can participate and work toward consensus. There is no one best way  for communicating with stakeholders, and different methods will be appropriate in different steps of the  Workbook. Workbook steps have lists of resources that can help with external communications. Appendix  B also has cross-references to other guides that may be helpful.  Partnering with another organization in your area that has similar interests in assessing climate change  can be a great opportunity. When you go through your communication and consultation process (Step  1), you should ask if your stakeholders want to join together to assess climate change effects. If you decide to partner with another organization on a vulnerability assessment, Step 2Establishing  the Context for the Vulnerability Assessment provides an opportunity to identify common goals you  will jointly consider. If the other organization is already a key partner, it is likely that there is significant  overlapping interest and a common context can be established for this assessment.  During Step 3Risk Identification and Step 4Risk Analysis, working together to identify and  assess risks can save resources or time, and lead to a common outcome. There can be great benefits  to collaborating, and you certainly should when it makes sense. Partners might assess the same risk  differently simply because their organizations have different purposes. Always remember to keep your  organizations needs in mind.  In Step 6Establishing the Context for the Action Plan and Step 7Risk Evaluation: Deciding on  a Course, partnering opportunities are an important part of the process. Identifying who has mutual  interests and who can take the lead in mitigating particular risks will be a great way to accomplish more  than any organization can do by itself. In Step 9Preparing and Implementing an Action Plan and Step 10Monitoring and Review, let  your partners know how you are doing. You will want to hear about their progress too.", "61": "Process You should reach out to others who are interested  in what you are doing or who can help with your  adaptation planning. Communicate the purpose  of this work to decision-makers within your  organization and to key stakeholders. Everyone  should understand what you are trying to  accomplish and the expected outcomes.  Be able to describe what happens in each of the  steps before reaching out. What you tell and ask  other people will be much more useful if you  know how the rest of the process will unfold.  Some may be involved throughout the entire  process, while others may have a particular  interest in a single step or area of focus. However,  when Step 5 is completed, key people should  not be surprised to learn that you have a climate  change vulnerability assessment and that you  will be using that assessment to determine what  further actions are necessary.  Reaching out Every organization has a unique group of  stakeholders. Local governments, nonprofits,  federal agencies or watershed groups all have  different structures and different parties that  pay attention to what they do. Who is involved  in climate change adaptation planning is an  organizational decision. Leading candidates  would include:   anyone who would be part of  organizational strategic planning;  anyone who would help decide an annual work plan;  anyone who could help with the vulnerability assessment; and  anyone who might be able to help with implementing adaptation actions. Including the public in your planning can be helpful. The Additional Resources section in this step has  many resources about how the community can help, as well as strategies for engaging with them. Communication and consultation should occur throughout your planning, not just when it starts  and ends. Actively review the information developed here in this step and listed in Table 1-1 before  each subsequent step and update it throughout the process to track and guide communication and  consultation efforts.", "62": "Reaching out Every organization has a unique group of  stakeholders.

However, it will be possible to explain what you will be doing, how conclusions will be  reached, and what could be the next steps. Along with the organizational goals and objectives you are  considering for this assessment, key messages should include the following:   This vulnerability assessment is being launched because there is reason to believe that climate  change impacts will affect what your organization is trying to accomplish.  The purpose of the vulnerability assessment is to understand the risks that may occur, the  likelihood of occurrence for each risk, and the consequence if a risk should occur.  Risk management is part of decision-making. If climate changes are going to affect your  organizations ability to reach its goals, then you need to know what the impacts might be in  order to continue being effective.  Different perspectives on risk identification, risk analysis and risk evaluation are important, and  participation is welcome.  The outcome of the vulnerability assessment is an understanding of likely climate change risks;  any adaptation actions will be determined after that. Key questions for your consultations with stakeholders By nature, your stakeholders are invested and concerned with what you are doing. They can be a great  help as you develop and ultimately implement your adaptation plan. Let them know how you plan to use  their input. Your communication and consultation should strive to find answers to key questions about  how stakeholders can improve your vulnerability assessment or action plan:  Do they have resources, reports or data that they can contribute?  Do they know of any climate change work on stressors or impacts that exists or is ongoing?   Do they want to actively participate in the process or simply be informed of progress or updates?   Can they help with risk identification or risk analysis?  When it is time to decide on adaptation actions, would they be able to help implement actions to  reduce risks?   Do they have any no-gos that you should know about? Are there any topics that they are not  willing to discuss or consider?", "64": "oals are the fundamental elements Goals are the natural unit for seeing what problems climate  change may present and therefore they have important  roles in the vulnerability assessment. Goals describe what your organization intends to achieve,  and are therefore perfect for defining the scope of your  vulnerability assessment. Your vulnerability assessment  should include everything that affects your goals, while  omitting everything that has no effect on them. A useful  Sidebar elaboration defining strategic goals.  Goals Strategic goals should reflect the  broad, long-term, outcomes the agency  aspires to achieve by implementing its  mission. Strategic goals communicate  the agency efforts to address national  problems, needs, challenges, and  opportunities on behalf of the American  people. Both the way strategic goals  are framed and the substance they  communicate are important to consider.  Strategic goals should reflect the  statutory mission of the agency, and  most agency activity will align to the  strategic goals. Strategic goals need not  be as specific as strategic objectives,  however, and need not reflect every  activity that the agency must undertake  to accomplish its mission. OMB. 2013. Circular No. A11 (2013), Section  230Agency Strategic Planning. End of sidebarBEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 21 Step 2 test that keeps your task from getting ever larger is to ask whether you would allocate resources for  efforts that have no effect on your goals. Your assessment should focus on the things your organization  cares about. You have already articulated your priorities when setting your goals. In addition, if there is no goal to test against climate stressors, then there will be no risks. The plain detail  that a stressor would cause something to occur in a place does not have meaning within itself. Once it  could affect a goal, an impact takes on a consequence. For example: you might identify that it could rain  tomorrowbut that would be just an incident; for many people that information would have no value.  However if you say it could rain tomorrow and we might not be able to have the picnic we planned, then  you introduce a consequence and you have a risk. A goal is the necessary piece for naming risks. There  will be climate change impacts all over your region but risks can only emerge if you cross climate change  stressors with your goals. Your organization may have goals that would be affected by climate change (e.g., controlling water  pollution or maintaining habitat) but may have others (e.g., recycling waste) that would not be affected  much at all. You will have to decide which of your organizations goals will be considered in this  vulnerability assessment. For a planning-level study like this, you should move forward with all of those  that could be affected by climate change.", "65": "Climate change stressors The Workbook uses seven types of climate change stressors to organize thinking:  Warmer summers (overall climate) This stressor is generally about the warm season being even warmer. This stressor (like warmer  winters, below) is about the general climate. Air, surface, soil and groundwater temperatures will  be warmer. The general climate effects of having warmer oceans or lakes are included here.  Warmer winters (overall climate) This stressor is about a cold season not being as cold as it formerly was.  Warmer water This stressor (regardless of season) comes from a higher temperature of water bodies (including  the ocean) and affects the chemical, physical or biological characteristics of the water body itself.  Increasing drought Drought is a deficiency in precipitation over an extended period. The magnitude of the  deficiency, the duration or the number of droughts could be greater.  Increasing storminess This category encompasses all aspects of intensifying precipitation in any form: more seasonal  precipitation, more total precipitation during events, higher rates of precipitation during events.  Stronger or more frequent instances of extratropical and tropical cyclones, blizzards or other  weather conditions are included here. If they are acting as stressors, then floods, waves, coastal  storm surge and wind are part of this storminess category.  Sea level rise This stressor is about the ocean being higher than it formerly was. It includes effects of higher  water levels right at the shore, as well as how elevated coastal water levels affect inland systems.  Ocean acidification  For the Workbook, this category is primarily conceptualized as related to ocean acidification via  atmospheric inputs of carbon dioxide", "66": "Risk paths Recall that a risk is the possibility that a given climate change stressor will affect your organizations  ability to meet its goals. Stressors and goals are embedded in the risk. You could be prevented from  reaching a goal because the environment changes in some way or because the projects you undertake  to reach your goal would fail in some way.  If there is any potential sequence (climate change stressor, and what follows) for an unwanted  consequence (not reaching your goal), then you have a risk. The risk develops along the path between  the cause and the effect. For example:  Stressor X could , and the result is that we might not attain Goal Y.   Warmer water (stressor) could lead to bacteria being more abundant in the river (path), and we  might not be able to provide healthy drinking water (unrealized goal).   More intense precipitation (stressor) could lead to flooding that knocks a sewage pump station  offline (path) and we might not be able to treat all the sewage that is discharged to the bay  (unrealized goal).  Sea level rise (stressor) will lead to more beach erosion (path) and we might not be able to  maintain the endangered bird species nesting sites (goal). Figure 3-1. The top diagram depicts an ideal business as usual scenario. At your place, your  organization undertakes various projects that help you to achieve your goals. In the bottom diagram a  climate change stressor is introduced to the business as usual situation (or to a no-action scenario). The  stressor could change the way the environment functions or change the effectiveness of the projects  that you would undertake, and potentially lead to unrealized goals. After the stressor is introduced, if  you can describe some chain of events that could happen that might keep you from realizing a goal,  then you have a risk. Local environment + Organizational projects Business as usual Climate change stressor Achieve goal Achieve goalBEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 26 Step 3 Paths can be simple or complex. Paths might involve contingencies or future human activity.  A diagram of a system can be very helpful for visualizing how climate change stressors could alter its  operations. It is not necessary to have climate change stressors in the diagram; the illustrations are just a  tool to help you think about where stressors could introduce unwanted effects. Diagrams can be simple  sketches of sequential events (Figure 3-2). If you can easily locate a conceptual diagram (Appendix D)  for a system comparable to yours, then a tool like that can be useful as well. Diagrams do not have to be  comprehensive or even exact representations of reality. They are simply tools to help you brainstorm and  identify risks. Most strategic initiatives are built on existing processes, and much of the organization is involved in the day-to-day work of delivering service to our customers. The Postal value chain is a series of closely linked processes, supported by a common infrastructure.  The overall quality and cost of the system depends not only on the actions of the Postal Service, but also on the actions of mailers and mail service providers. Value Chain U.S. Postal Service Figure 3-2. A visual depiction of the current system helps with identifying risks. Climate change  stressors like increasing storminess or hotter summers can be imagined to affect efficient mail delivery  in many ways. A diagram like this, from the USPS FY 2012 Annual Report to Congress, helps prompt  questions such as How would more wind and rain affect maintenance at post offices? Would hotter  conditions require more air conditioning? Does increasing temperature affect vehicle or aircraft  operations? Would more intense precipitation or more heat alert days affect mail delivery? You  might have come up with these risks even without an illustrationbut if you can have a diagram that  helps you think, then use it. What you need to do Every path that you can conceive is a risk to a goal and should be recorded in this risk identification step.  At this point, you need to rely on your expertise and knowledge about your system. In this step you want  to come up with as many of those possible pathways as you can.  Cross each climate change stressor with each of the goals you listed in Step 2. The intent is to  generate a list of the ways that each stressor could keep you from reaching the goal. This is much like  a brainstorming session. See Figure 3-3 for an example of how the process works for one goal and one  stressor.BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 27 Step 3 Figure 3-3. An example of how to generate a list of what could happen in the space between  introduction of a stressor and failure to realize a goal. Record each risk (stressor, path and goal) in Table 3-3. If a potential risk is not identified in this step, it  will not move forward in the vulnerability assessment process, so write down everything. Step 4Risk  Analysis and Step 5Risk Evaluation: Comparing Risks are where you analyze and evaluate the list of  risks you generate in this step. Dont dismiss risks! Even risks that you might think are insignificant should be captured in this step. Dont prematurely  dismiss anything. You may learn that a stakeholder thinks it is important, or in some instances further  analysis might show that a risk is not trivial at all. If you dismiss it now, it does not get considered later.  If it is in fact a trivial risk, the systematic process of risk management allows it to be assigned to such  a category in Step 4. Treat this step as a brainstorming session and document every risk you and your  team can identify. Risks are not inevitable A risk is not certain to happen, a risk could happen. You will analyze its likelihood in Step 4. Further, if  you decide that you want to change its likelihood, understanding the risk path could help you to find  ways to take action. You probably cannotby yourselfchange a stressor coming from global climate  change, and you probably dont want to change your goal, so if you do want to change the likelihood or  consequence of the risk you have to disrupt the path that transfers the risk from stressor to goal.  More than one problem from the same cause The same environmental stressor may intersect with several of your goals. You may find that you  seemingly identify the same risk many times. As an example, sea level rise may push saltwater farther up  rivers. This could have implications for drinking water sources, freshwater wetlands or shellfish habitat.  This is why you are asked to note which organizational goal is associated with a risk. Goals are implicitly  embedded in risks. In this sea level rise example, you really havent identified the same risk of saltwater  Warmer water   Toxicity of pollutants  may increase   Water can hold less  dissolved oxygen   Greater algae growth  may occur   Parasites and bacteria  have greater abundance,  survival or transmission Climate change stressor Paths Unrealized goal Maintain water qualityBEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 28 Step 3 reaching farther upstream three times: you have identified three separate risks that stem from the same  stressor-driven process. You might design an adaptation action for the drinking water risk that leaves the  other two risks intact: they really are three different risks.  Help identifying risks This step has four tables (Tables 3-1a through 3-1d) that cross-reference the seven types of climate  change stressors with the purposes of clean water legislation to provide a starter list of more than 100  potential risks. If your organization has other types of goals, then add those goals to a table like Table  3-2 and identify the relevant climate change risks. More places to turn for risk references are listed in the  Additional Resources section. Opportunities (possibility of benefits) You might identify potential circumstances arising from any of the seven climate change stressors that  could be beneficial instead of harmful. These may reduce the severity of some other risk or just be  positive outcomes on their own. If it is the latter, an opportunity may free resources to address other  risks or even change the way your organization goes about business. If you identify any opportunities  related to your organizations goals, make note of them. They will be picked back up in your action plan  to ensure that you take advantage of them.", "67": "Process This is the most intensive step of the vulnerability assessment. You will use Table 4-1 to characterize each  risk in five areas: (1) consequence, (2) likelihood, (3) spatial extent of the impact, (4) time horizon until the  problem begins, and (5) habitat type. This will become important information when your organization  determines its adaptation priorities.  Each risk needs to be assigned to the minimum number of people or teams (ideally just one) who can  provide a reliable initial analysis. You need an initial analysis of each risk along with some documentation  of the sources (which could be expert judgement). Try not to get stuck on determining the likelihood  or consequence of any one risk. Right now this will be an initial or a working determination. As more  information becomes available over time, or as others are able to assist, you can return to this step and  adjust the determination accordingly.  Whereas the Workbook methodology brings others into the process in Step 5, it could be desirable to  include others now if stakeholders indicated that they would help you with this part of your vulnerability  assessment. The involvement of more than one person can lead to differences in whether risks are rated  high, medium or low. The intent of this step is to provide one initial rating so that it can be refined via  wider consultation and participation in Step 5Risk Evaluation: Comparing Risks. If you do receive  divergent input in this step, you need to come to a conclusion about which rating you will provisionally  adopt. Differences could be worked out here or postponed to Step 5. Figure 4-1. In this step, each risk from the list compiled in Step 3 is separately assigned to someone  (or to a team) who is qualified to come up with qualitative determinations of likelihood, consequence,  spatial extent, time horizon or habitat type. Others will be invited to review these determinations in  Step 5.", "68": "How precise do you need to be? This process requires a determination of the relative importance of each risk. You want to sort risks into a  fitting high-medium-low category: absolute precision is not needed.  Your aim in this step is to have risk determinations that are not wrong. Wrong would be saying high  and later changing a rating to low or vice versa. If the rating is believed to be correct, if you could  make a decent argument as to why you rated it that way and you do not expect to be changing it, if you  would be open to revision if compelling new information were provided, then that is sufficient precision  for this step. It is recommended that you use available information to rate a risk, as you will likely have many risks that  you have to work through and launching a bevy of new research studies will be impractical. Indicate how  the determination was made and what information or who was consulted, and move on to the next risk.  As new information surfaces and others are later able to provide additional information, you can revisit  the determination and adjust it if necessary.", "69": "Who should participate? How you choose to complete your initial risk analysis will be highly influenced by staff capabilities and  interests, as well as by the size, subject fields and availability of the expert pool you turn to. Three main  types of people should be invited to participate in this step: Your in-house staff: No one knows your program as well as the staff. If they have the ability to make a  first determination about the risks, then you should let the staff do as much as they can. Working on this  will also raise their knowledge about climate impacts. Experts: You probably already turn to specialists or professionals whenever you need to go beyond  your in-house knowledge or skills. Experts in climate, environmental sciences or natural resources from  government agencies, universities, NGOs or consulting companies who are familiar with your study  area could assist your staff with this climate change risk analysis. Experts could also be asked to do  the analysis themselves. Local experts (like the director of a public works department or professional  landscapers) can also contribute. They might in fact be the best people to estimate the consequence of  a risk. Partners: When you did your initial stakeholder consultation, people may have indicated that they had  expertise or knowledge in particular domains. It will be useful to bring those experts back into the  process now, especially if they said they could help with this step. For example, it may be useful to have  the president of the fishing club weigh in on the consequences of warmer water. You can approach different people about likelihood and consequence ratings for the same risk. For  example, you might ask climate experts about the likelihood of a risk and turn to in-house staff for a  determination of its consequences or its spatial extent.", "70": "If you turn to experts or selected stakeholders Carefully consider which risks you would like an expert or selected stakeholders to weigh in on and  whether you would like them to comment on the likelihood or consequence (or both) of that risk. Keep  in mind that the goal here is to generate an initial analysis. Consult with those who can fill in gaps with  particular, needed expertise. In Step 5 you will share what you have done more broadly to help reach  agreement. In this step, you only should do what is necessary to get off to a good start.BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 38 Step 4 If you reach out to others in this step, it will be helpful to communicate the following information:   An overview of the vulnerability assessment process, including identification of your organizations  goals.  Which risks you would like their input on and whether you would like their determination on the  likelihood or consequence (or both) of that risk.  That a qualitative scale is being used to determine the likelihood and consequence for each risk see What you (or those you consult) need to determine below.  The level of effort that is or is not needed right now.  That a justification, rationale or source for their input would be helpfu", "71": "What you (or those you consult) need to determine Risks will be ranked on a qualitative scale for consequence, likelihood, spatial scale of the impact,  and time horizon. It is helpful to note the justification or source used to determine the likelihood and  consequence of each risk, as it will be a useful reference later on in the process (if you need to revisit this,  or to find out more when you are planning adaptation actions).  The Workbook uses scales with three divisions (high-medium-low). In order for this exercise to be most  useful, you must have a spread of likelihoods and consequences for the risks identified. If everything is  ranked as high-likelihood and high-consequence, the vulnerability assessment process is going to be less  effective as a decision-making tool. In the situation where a disproportionate number of risks are falling  into the high category, you should probably expand your definition of medium to capture more risks.  It may be helpful to define what each category (high-medium-low) means for your organization. Note that in the descriptions below for each parameter, the qualitative category (a) is always best and  (c) is the worst.  Consequence Consequence is the effect the risk would have on your organizations goal were it to occur.  (a) Low (life will go on; not as important as many other things; could adjust) (b) Medium (c) High (major disruption; goal is out of reach or not even attainable) Likelihood Likelihood is the chance of the risk actually occurring (i.e., probability). For the risk, you determine how  likely it is to affect the goal.  (a) Low (b) Medium (c) High For planning purposes you can avoid attaching quantitative probability labels to categories. Unless you  have access to a large team of top scientists and a lot of supercomputers for simulating the climate at the  scale of your study area and running the appropriate hydrological, hydraulic, demographic, land use, and  ecological models, your mathematical estimate of probability is not going to be any more accurate than  the qualitative category anyway.  Since this is a qualitative analysisto aid future decision-making by spreading the risks over three  categories, you could define your likelihoods so that 20%40% of your risks fall in each of the high- medium-low groupings (unless you have a large number of risks that are not likely to occur). All the risks  in the high category would be more likely to occur than those in the medium category, and likewise for  medium and low. Spatial extent Spatial extent refers to the proportion of your geographic area that the risk will affect (recall that the  Introduction states that this Workbook methodology works best at a spatial scale that is large enough  that risks are numerous and diverse and small enough that managers know the territory). Knowing  whether problems are isolated or widespread will help you in the action planning process as you decide  how best to use limited resources.  (a) Site (e.g., a few waterfront lots, a bridge, a sewage treatment plant) (b) Place or region (e.g., community, harbor, state park, wildlife refuge, sub-watershed) (c) Extensive (most of the watershed or most of the estuary) If a different spatial scale is more appropriate for your situation, then feel free to modify these  categories.  Sidebar elaboration on why qualitative scales are emphasized for use in this workbook.  Using a qualitative scale A qualitative scale at this stage is useful for several reasons:  Future changes in the climate system cannot be projected with the exactness that is needed to precisely  quantify the probability of a risk at any given future time.   You might need to contend with well over a hundred distinct risks. It would be prohibitively expensive  to scientifically quantify the likelihood of each one, as well as to estimate the cost of damages each risk  poses. The cost of doing the risk assessment should not exceed the cost of mitigating risks themselves.  The general public has a poor ability to process statistical probability. Research on decision theory  shows that giving people mathematically identical choices elicits different responses depending on how  a problem is framed.   It will be much easier to reach agreement on a qualitative rank (high-medium-low) than on whether  mathematical calculations of likelihood or consequence were done correctly. Some people might elect to use numbers to express a qualitative value (e.g., rank 15). Keep in mind  that these numbers are probably symbolizing subjective values because there is no easy mathematical  way to accurately derive one true quantitative value for each risk. If you are using numerals to represent  opinions, they are still categories. Unless going from category 1 to 2 truly represents the same  quantitative change as going from category 3 to 4, and respectively likewise for all the other numerical  relationships, you cannot properly add, multiply or divide with the numerals, or find their mean (although  median and mode are valid).  Be sure to look ahead to Step 5 and Steps 68b to understand how these categories will be used if you  are tempted to increase the number of categories or to do math with them. Is it really going to be helpful  to use 5-point scales or 10-point scales to generate 25 or 100 different classes of risk? Are you actually  going to use that level of differentiation to make decisions? The key thing here is not to overcomplicate the  process.

End of sidebarBEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 40 Step 4 Time horizon Time horizon until the problem begins will help with developing your action plan. Decisions about low  or medium problems that will not emerge for decades could be postponed. Conversely, high-impact  problems that are already occurring need some attention right away.  (a) More than 30 years (b) 1030 years (c) Already occurring or 010 years Treat the time horizon for the risk as being independent of the likelihood of it occurring. If you think that  absolute dates are more appropriate than relative time periods, choose whatever works best for your  situation. Habitat type Habitat type is a category that is not necessarily a risk dimension. Identifying it now as you go through  your risk analysis and develop your table will become useful later when you work on an action plan in  Steps 610. When deciding on adaptation actions, you may want to group all of the risks associated  with a certain type of habitat. You might, for example, want to see all of the risks associated with tidal  wetlands or with residential areas. Looking across all the associated risks can help you choose adaptation  actions that address more than one risk.", "72": "How to proceed when climate projections give a range of answers Environmental managers have always had to deal with uncertainty when making decisions. It is important  to be transparent about the magnitude of the uncertainty, the range of possible outcomes, and the  resulting justification for making a specific decision. Nevertheless, sufficient information currently exists  to make good determinations about whether a risk is likely to lead to small or large problems. For the purposes of this analysis, knowing the direction  of the change is often enough. For example, you do not  need to determine whether sea level will be 1.25 feet, 1.5  feet or 1.75 feet higher 45 years from now. Instead, think  about what your system will be like when sea level is 1.25  feet, 1.5 feet or 1.75 feet higher in the coming decades.  Similarly, you probably do not need to determine whether  it is going to be 4F or 6F warmer. Think about what the  impacts will be at the low and high ends of your annual  temperature range when temperatures are consistently  warmer than they are now, or phenomena happen earlier  in the spring or later in the fall.  Sidebar elaboration on why the workbook methodology might not be suited for all problems.  Urgent problems Ultimately, if the scale or urgency of a  problem is so big that planning estimates  are not adequate, then you have to turn  to other risk management techniques  for those risks. The methodology of this  Workbook is not the right approach for  problems that need precise, quantified  answers. See Appendix C. End of sidebarBEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 41 Step 4 As you are assessing your risks, it may be helpful to indicate the level of certainty associated with each  risk. When you evaluate the risks in Step 5Risk Evaluation: Comparing Risks and later decide which  ones to move forward with in your action plan, you may find that there are some risks for which there is  great uncertainty and you need more information before investing resources to mitigate them.  When using the Workbook methodology to conduct a vulnerability assessment, use the best available  information and use an iterative process that allows you to reassess the identified risks as new  information arises.  How to proceed when climate projections give opposing answers As you move through your risk analysis, you may discover a situation in which climate projections indicate  different directions of change. For example, while examining the likelihood of more frequent drought  for your watershed, you might discover that some climate models show there will be more precipitation  events and less drought, while other models say that drought conditions will become more frequent. There are lots of climate models, and several standard scenarios that each could run. Because each  model is slightly different and the scenarios differ in their assumptions, every combination will have  a different result than every other simulation. Sometimes model results cluster in a narrow range;  sometimes that range is wider; sometimes the range includes both positive and negative projections of  change. How to proceed is related to how confident you would be about deciding on one direction of change  and its approximate magnitude. Your answers to the following questions about model outputs can  influence your decision:  Do you have an outlier model?  Do you have a continuous range of model results that happens to encompass zero?  Do you have two clusters of model results?  Do you have model results that are scattered all over the place? If your sense is that there is enough of a modeling consensus for you to move forward, then proceed.  But if your sense is that the best available climate change information is saying that anything could  happen, then in the process of gathering more information you have now identified a condition that  might lead to new risks. New risks come because your conclusion that climate could change in opposite ways has introduced a  new stressor. To continue the drought example, the increasing drought stressor would remain and you  would now have an opposite less-frequent drought stressor too. You might not think that less-frequent  drought is a stressor, but it is a change from current conditions and that could lead to some unwanted  changes in the environment. The potential for new risks might best be handled by returning to Step 3 Risk Identification and generating a new set of risks that would stem from the opposite stressor. Then  come back to this step with any newly identified risks. You will have to decide how to allocate likelihood  for the risks associated with the stressor pair. If you concluded that anything could happen then you  probably should not assign high likelihood to risks related to either half of the duo.", "73": "Thresholds or tipping points Tips occur when small actions, events or changes have large effects on future states. Environmental  systems that respond to climate changes by crossing thresholds will complicate your risk analysis. When BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 42 Step 4 an ecological threshold is reached, things that were changing gradually (if at all) suddenly change  abruptly. A low impact suddenly becomes high, or a local problem is suddenly everywhere, or a present/ absent switch occurs. Even if you do not know when a tipping point will be reached, you might be able  to anticipate that it will be reached. When sea level rise will push salty water upstream to a sensitive  freshwater marsh, or when the winter will become a frost-free season, cannot be known precisely.  However, anticipating these thresholds will better prepare you in the event that they do occur.  A risk could have a set of determinations about consequence/likelihood/area/timing that apply before  the threshold is reached and another for after. One strategy would be to split the risk into two risks: a  before-after pair. An alternative is to keep the risk intact and proceed with your risk analysis by answering  some questions:  Do you need to take action anyway? If this is a risk that will warrant attention even before a  threshold is reached, how you choose to respond may also affect the onset of the transition.  Mitigating a low risk now may head off the change to a high risk later.  Is the threshold reversible? If it is crossed, can you take actions that would undo the change, or  is it a one-way transition? Losing an endangered species is irreversible. Sometimes reversing the  change is theoretically possible but unrealistic. Try to stay in the plausible part of the spectrum.  How long will an effective response take? If you must respond to the risk if you do cross the  threshold, is the time to adequately respond short or long? If the consequences after crossing the threshold are high, and (because of permits, costs or other  foreseeable problems) it would take a long time to effectively respondwhether before or after a  tipping point is reachedthen this is a high risk, even if the time of onset is unknown.", "74": "Use existing information This application of the risk management process is intended to be completed with existing information  and resources. New fine-scale climate modeling is not required for the type of qualitative analysis this  vulnerability assessment supports, but use it if it already exists and is easy to obtain.  At the time of this publication, climate model outputs for monthly temperature and precipitation are  easily available for U.S. counties or finer resolutions.3  These should be more than sufficient for a planning- level vulnerability assessment where you are looking to sort risks into high-medium-low categories.", "75": "Process After the people you consulted in Step 4 provide you with an initial analysis of your risks, you have  an opportunity to turn to a wider set of people. Your partners and stakeholders can react to the  determinations about consequence and likelihood, and help you to make sure they are accurate. Create a consequence/probability matrix A C/P matrix is a useful communication tool and will help  guide decision-making about which risks your organization  will address in your action plan. In Step 4Risk Analysis you determined an initial consequence and likelihood for  each risk. In this step you will map each risk to a cell or box  on a matrix using those characteristics. You will create a  matrix like the example in Figure 5-1.  ", "76": "Ask your stakeholders and advisors to help Once you have your C/P matrix, reach out to the key  stakeholders and partners for their input or concurrence in  order to verify that you were on the right track in previous  steps. You can reach out to individuals separately or  convene a workshop. You can ask some people to just  look at some of the risks. There are many ways to get feedback on your initial risk analysis. The more  knowledgeable people who can review your C/P matrix, the better (up to the point of diminishing  returns). You may find it useful to mark up your C/P matrix (which could be done separately for each goal,  stressor or habitat type, or which may span several sheets of paper if printed) to include information from  stakeholder consultation. You could also track input with additional notes to Table 4-1.  There are advantages to asking others to participate. However, do this prudently: the primary purpose  here is to get the best risk evaluation you can get. You do not want this to turn into a vote about what  is important, nor do you want people angling for their issues to get ranked higher. The vulnerability  assessment is about risks to your organizations goals. Try to keep that the focus. Ask for thoughts on your risk analysis:  Do they generally agree with how the risks are placed in the C/P matrix?   Are there additional risks (pertaining to your organizations goals) that should be added to the  matrix? Ask for feedback about the risks themselves:  Are any of them priority risks for your stakeholders? Alternatively, are there any that they do not  want to be addressed?  Are there stakeholders or partners who are working to address any of the risks through their own  programs?", "77": "Reaching agreement Each risk can have only one ranking for its likelihood and one ranking for its consequence.

Revise the tables you created in Step 4Risk Analysis as well (be especially sure to keep track of the  reasons for any updates you make).

Congratulations!  There is a lot of work to do still, but you are off to a great start. Use your vulnerability assessment and the C/P matrix as a communication tool. It may be helpful to do  the following:   Publish it online so that it is available within your community.

You could find  that some of your goals will be difficult to attain if the climate changes as expected.

Partners will be essential in the action  planning half of climate change adaptation too. They can help you deal with risks that you may not be  able to handle yourself. Solving problems together, dividing up tasks, identifying lead agencies, and  finding who can contribute human or financial resources will help everyone to achieve your common  goals. Although all of the risks you identified in your vulnerability assessment could prevent you from achieving  your goals, your organization may not be able to mitigate every risk. The availability of partners who  can help with a risk may make a big difference in the approach you select. Be aware that some of your  contextual limitations may apply to your partners as well. Use Table 6-2 to note any common organizational goals, objectives or work areas where potential  partners could help you. This list does not represent a commitment by either party.

To accomplish the objective of this step requires a little bit of finessing the chicken and egg dilemma. In  a systematic methodology, like the one this Workbook uses, when you have scores of risks and limited  resources, the dilemma is:   You can choose to mitigate each risk or use some other risk handling approach for each one.  Should you decide your approach before you even know whether there would be any suitable  mitigating actions you could take?  Investigating the options for mitigating a risk will take time and resources. You already know how  many risks are in your vulnerability assessment and that you might never be able to mitigate  each one; further there will be some that you know you never will act to mitigate. Should you still  expend the effort to investigate options for mitigating every risk so that you can make a logical  informed choice about whether to mitigate them? Basicallyshould you decide what to do and then investigate it further, or when you cant do everything  should you still investigate it all before deciding what to do? Trying to have one logical, systematic  process is what introduces the procedural difficulty. By definition, there is no easy way to resolve a  dilemma, but you will try to make it a smaller problem from two directions:  First you will get some familiarity with the mitigating actions that are circulating in the planning  world. Knowing that options might exist for your situation will help you to decide whether  mitigating any risk looks likely to succeed.   Second, because mitigation requires you to expend resources, you will try to screen out risks that  seem suitable for another approach. You want to filter the set of risks to decide where you will focus your resources. The idea is to head out  of this step with a reduced set of risks that you would prefer to mitigate and for which you might be able  to supply an appropriate mitigating action. Recording your high-level approach for each risk in Table 7-1  will set you up for Step 8aFinding Adaptation Actions and Step 8bSelecting Adaptation Actions,  where you will make finer deliberations about how and whether to proceed.

The Climate Ready Estuaries Synthesis of Adaptation Options for Coastal Areas, as well as other  documents (see the Additional Resources section of this step and Step 8a), will provide a sense for  what might work for your location and combination of risks. You might also recognize that some actions  address more than one risk.  While you will not be selecting actions in this step, having some familiarity  with ones your organization could take will be helpful. A fair amount of  work remains in Step 8a and Step 8b before you will select a specific  mitigation technique to use. Do not be too critical right now. In the same  way the Workbook advises not to dismiss risks while you are preparing  your vulnerability assessment, you should not dismiss actions here right  now. You will be tempted to bring in your organizations context or other  knowledge to eliminate possible actions. However, judgments about how  realistic something is will be coming back into this very soon.  For this part of Step 7, just understand what kind of mitigating actions are  in circulation and use your professional knowledge to simply think about  whether any would work to lower your risks if you (or someone else) could  implement them", "85": "Approaches for each risk Although these decisions will be made at a high level, you are deciding an approach for risks that  you determined have the potential to affect your organizations ability to meet its goals. You need to  be prudent as well as aware that how you choose to approach your risks will determine where your  adaptation actions are focused going forward. Your context and constraints will have a big influence on the approach you select. It will be helpful to  consult partners and stakeholders as you determine the approach for each risk. Some risks may be very  important to a stakeholder group, or work may already be underway to address other risks. It will also be  helpful to consider the spatial scale of the impact. You may opt for a different approach depending on  whether it affects a small or large area.  Risk management uses four general approaches for responding to any given risk:  Mitigate.  Transfer.  Accept.  Avoid. Mitigating a risk is the one approach in which your organization would be making changes to the risk  path (Step 3). The other approaches handle risk more administratively.", "86": "Mitigate Mitigating a risk involves taking actions to reduce the likelihood and/or consequence of the threat to  your goals. ", "87": "Transfer Transfer is a technical risk management term for having another organization take responsibility for  reducing the risk. Your risk is mitigated by another party. Buying an insurance policy is an example of  transferring risk by having another party reduce the consequences if the risk occurs. An environmental  management organization will probably not be buying insurance policies, but transfers can occur when  other organizations will act in ways to reduce your risks. Maybe your risk could be mitigated when a  highway is rebuilt or as part of other infrastructure work. Maybe you can agree to lead a reforestation  effort if a partner agrees to restore some other habitat. Maybe some agency has announced it will  be taking hazard mitigation actions that would have the co-benefit of reducing some of your risk. If  others actions are lowering the likelihood or consequence of your risks then you have transferred the  risk reduction responsibility to them. You arent mitigating the risk, but it is being reduced. Note that  you cannot unilaterally transfer a risk. Other organizations need to affirm that they will actually mitigate  the risk; otherwise the risk will still be there. You can opt to transfer some of a risk by partnering with  another organization or by making a financial contribution to someone elses mitigation project. If you  are working with partner organizations on your adaptation plan, this is an opportunity to decide which  organization is going to be the lead for which risks.", "88": "Accept You may have to consider accepting a risk if you are unable to mitigate or transfer it through a viable  strategy. Accepting a risk means that your organization will continue with business as usual and run the  risk, dealing with the impact if/when it does occur. You might choose to accept a risk for some time,  and then later begin to work on mitigating it. Reasons to accept a risk could include a long time horizon  before impacts are expected, inability to locate a suitable mitigation strategy, or a lack of worry about  the consequence of the risk. If more resources or information become available, you can re-evaluate and  decide if there is an opportunity to use another approach besides accept for a risk.  If you dont make a choice to use any other approach, then by default you have elected to accept a risk.  You are running the risk", "89": "Avoid The mitigate/transfer/accept approaches assume that you do not want to change your organizations  goals. If those three approaches are not feasible for you, then you may want to avoid a risk by narrowing  goals that are related to this risk. Avoiding is about being out of the risk altogether so it will not affect  you. Typically, avoiding a risk involves eliminating its root cause. However, since your organization by  itself will not stop climate change from occurring, and since you cannot relocate your place, avoiding  a risk in this context would require a shift in your organizations operations or goals so that you are no  longer exposed to that risk. For example, if one of your goals is to maintain some resource, but you  conclude that climate change is making that a lost cause, you could relinquish that goal. Avoiding a  risk does not mean the impact to the resource or to your place goes awaythis is an administrative  handling of risk in which you move away from this objective and you will no longer put resources toward  it. Avoiding a risk may be a radical move for an organization: you will be pulling back from work that you  thought was important. Reserve this approach for risks that will not be mitigated (by you or others) and  where accepting the risk is a bad proposition.", "90": "Avoid vs. accept The Workbook often states that if more information becomes available you should go back to earlier  steps. In the iterative process of risk management, choosing avoid for a risk appears to be something  new that has lots of other implications for your adaptation plan. If you are renouncing a goal, then all the  risks you identified in Step 3, which derive from that goal, would seem to vanish too. Thus those risks  would fall out of your matrix and vulnerability assessment. If they are not in your vulnerability assessment,  they would not make it into this step of action planning either. Logically, deciding to avoid a risk makes it  and everything related to it disappear. Instead of acting right away on this logic, you should let your choice of avoid sit for now. The  implications to your risks and goals arising from an iteration do not go away but are not an immediate  problem. Instead, you want to leave open the possibility that even more information could be coming.  The risk may turn out to be more benign than you thought; a new risk mitigation technology might  emerge; a new partner may agree to help you with the risk; windfall funding might come in; etc. If you  expunge the risk and the goal from your vulnerability assessment and action plan, you have nothing to  go back to if you do get more information. Keep the risk and the goal, and keep track of the fact that  you chose to avoid the risk. Things might change that would eventually let you select a mitigate/transfer/ accept approach.  Tracking a risk you choose to avoid keeps a goal on the books. You stop working on the goal itself but  do not drop it completely. Pragmatically, it really does not matter what your goal is or is not if you are  not going to put any resources into trying to reach it. The difference between the accept and avoid  approaches to a climate change risk thus become the difference between business as usual toward a  goal and no action toward a goal. Tabl", "91": "hoosing an approach for each risk Every risk that is on your matrixwhether in the high, medium or low categoryrepresents a potential  event that you determined could keep your organization from meeting its goals. In many cases you can  transfer all or some of the risk to a partner, you can simply accept and run a risk, or you can change your  goals so you avoid it altogether. If these are feasible or palatable then they are what you should do.  What you cannot transfer and do not want to accept or avoid, you must mitigate yourself. Mitigating a risk: Every risk that has a potential action that could lower it could be assigned to this  category. Actions that are easy, that you would do in pursuit of no-regrets or win-win solutions, or that  you simply think your organization should do, should be in this category. Accepting a risk: If you turn to your vulnerability assessment, you will find a time horizon determination  for each risk. All green risks in your C/P matrix (Step 5) are good candidates for an accept approach. The  farther out in time they seem to be, the better the accept approach gets. Yellow risks that are decades  away are also good candidates for the accept approach. Not accepting a risk: Risks with a high impact (red risks in your C/P matrix) are bad candidates for the  accept approach. You and your team identified these risks as highly likely to derail your organization. In  order to continue to function as an effective organization that can meet its goals, you should probably  choose another approach for these high-impact risks.  Risks you could accept but should assign for mitigation: These are the green risks that are happening  now as well as the yellow risks that are expected within the next 1030 years. The green risks are low- consequence problems anyway, and you have some time to respond to the yellow risks (unless the  response requires a very long lead time). Assigning them to the mitigation approach has the potential  advantage of keeping them moving through your adaptation planning steps.  If you assign these green or yellow risks to the accept approach, they will be out of sight and out of mind  as you create your action plan. The advantage of bringing them forward is that they will be in front of you  when you are trying to decide the mitigating actions you do need to pursue. Actions that might address BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 61 Step 7 higher risks could address these lower risks too. You might select some actions over others if you are  actively aware that they address lower risks too. Carrying these risks into the mitigation planning (Figure  7-2) may lead to better organizational choices about actions than if the risks are assigned to the accept  approach.", "92": "Further, if the climate changes faster than you expect or if you were too optimistic in your time horizon  determination, then by the time you complete another iteration of your vulnerability assessment, these  unwanted risks may already be upon you.  If you are not sure about mitigation: You are not obligated to start responding, but if you think you  would want to mitigate a risk in the future, then you could benefit from the risk management process  now by assigning it to the mitigation approach. In the systematic risk management process, only those  risks that you identify for mitigation will be carried forward to Step 8a and Step 8b, where you will select  adaptation actions for the risks, and to Step 9, where you will develop your plan. The other riskswhich  you are deciding not to actively mitigate but to transfer/accept/avoidwill be picked up in Step 10 Monitoring and Review after you write your plan. If Step 8a and Step 8b show you that there is not a  viable mitigation strategy for a particular risk, you can return to this step and choose another approach", "93": "Approving the approach After you have investigated and chosen a high-level approach (mitigate/transfer/accept/avoid) for every  one of your risks, your organizations key decision-makers (board of directors, management committee,  staff, and the people who are regularly involved with deciding what you do) should agree before you go  further with your action plan. Your organization is preparing a major strategy document. While this is not  a new strategic plan, it is a statement of how you plan to continue being able to achieve your mission  and goals.  If you selected the avoid approach for any of your risks, you need to carefully think through what this  means. You have chosen to withdraw from whatever goal would be thwarted by the risk. This may be  the whole goal if the goal is narrow (e.g., maintain critical habitat for a particular bird species), or it may  be a part of a goal if the goal is broad (e.g., maintain ecological diversity in your watershed). If you are  deciding to withdraw from pursuing a goal (and thereby in effect rewriting your strategic plan), key  decision-makers should approve this change in course.", "94": "To Get Started You need to mitigate everything that you cannot transfer and do not want to accept or avoid (Figure  7-3). Deciding which risks you want to mitigate may not be the best way to begin. For a first round of  decision-making it may be easier to leave the mitigation option for last, after you have rejected the other  strategies. To get started you should identify the risks that you can transfer to another willing party.  ", "95": "Finding mitigating actions that look promising As you find the points along a risk pathway where opportunities exist to mitigate the risk (Figure 8a-3),  you need to rely on your knowledge about your system to think about what actions might be promising.  You are looking for actions to apply at the relevant spots in the risk path in order to lower the likelihood  or consequence of a risk. Your professional knowledge and training may lead you in certain directions. As you were familiarizing  yourself with options in Step 7, additional ideas may have interested you. If your organization goals are  similar to the Clean Water Act goals, then Table 8a-1 of the Workbook presents the actions from CREs  Synthesis of Adaptation Options for Coastal Areas in a new format that you might find useful. If your  organization has goals specific to the management of water utilities, see resources from EPAs Climate  Ready Water Utilities program. For other sets of organizational goals, the Additional Resources section  at the end of this step points to sources of potential actions.  There are hundreds of potential actions that would alter a risk path and reduce the risks consequence/ probability. Many actions are trivial; some are practically impossible. You want to identify a plausible  range of actions in this step. This is probably not as open-ended a brainstorming exercise as it sounds,  but do not reject things that are novel. You want a range of actions because in Step 8b you may decide  that some are unpalatable for various reasons and should be rejected. Having a plausible range of  actions will help you find opportunities to use actions that might mitigate more than one risk, bring  co-benefits, or open up other opportunities. The best way to solve one particular risk might not be  as advantageous as a second-best way that mitigates other risks too. It is fine (probably desirable) to  identify the same action for more than one risk", "96": "Criteria to assess actions In addition to risk reduction potential, which you conditionally affirmed in the last step, the Workbook uses five other sets of questions (Americas Climate Choices Summary Report, p. 46) to apply to the pool  of potential actions.  Feasibility and effectiveness.  Cost and cost-effectiveness.  Ancillary costs and benefits.  Equity and fairness.  Robustness. Risk reduction potential  You already considered the risk reduction potential of  actions in Step 8a by affirming that you expect each  adaptation action (by itself or by a combination of actions)  to move a risk at least one box on your consequence/ probability matrix. Do you still believe that? Feasibility and effectiveness  Is the action a proven strategy? Are there other  places that have successfully implemented this  action?  Do you have enough time to implement it to prevent  risks from occurring?  Is it politically feasible?  Do you have, or can you get, authority or permission  to implement it?  Is it something your community/stakeholders would  accept? Cost and cost-effectiveness  Is it affordable? Which category does the cost of  the adaptation action fit?  Minor. Sidebar elaboration on what it means to manage for change.  Managing for change Beyond managing for resilience,  the Nations capability to adapt will  ultimately depend on our ability to  be flexible in setting priorities and  managing for change. Prioritizing  actions and balancing competing  management objectives at all scales of  decision making is essential, especially in  the midst of shifting budgets and rapidly  changing ecosystems....Over time, our  ability to manage for resilience of  current systems in the face of climate  change will be limited as temperature  thresholds are exceeded, climate  impacts become severe and irreversible,  and socioeconomic costs of maintaining  existing ecosystem structures, functions,  and services become excessive. At this  point, it will be necessary to manage  for change, with a re-examination of  priorities and a shift to adaptation  options that incorporate information on  projected ecosystem changes.

Very expensive, requiring external assistance.  Overwhelming and impossible.  Is the cost reasonable for the risk reduction an  action would produce?

Some of the most effective options may also be the most  expensive. The conversethe cheapest actions might be  the least effectivealso holds. Later in this step you will  consider how your available resources affect how many  actions you can implement and how much risk reduction  you can achieve. Ancillary costs and benefits  Is the action maladaptive?  Does action in one sector/place cause problems  in another sector/place?  Will action to reduce some risks encourage  people to take other risks they would have  avoided otherwise?  Does the action close off other options or lock  the future onto one path?  Co-benefitsdoes an action create positive side  effects that help with other non-climate problems or  with more than one climate change risk?

Are there adverse impacts on the environment,  ecosystem functions or ecosystem services? Equity and fairness  Does it align with your ethics and principles?  Does it cause a minority population or low-income  population to bear disproportionately high and  adverse effects?  Sidebar elaboration on the definition of sustainability and its three pillars.

Executive Order 13514 of October 5,  2009 The ultimate goal of adaptation is to  create a sustainable place (otherwise  adaptation actions are just patches and  short-term fixes). You want to create  places that will be resilient to the risks  that future climate changes will pose.

End of sidebarBEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 84 Step 8b  Are many asked to pay for benefits that accrue to just a few?  Does the action limit the adaptation options of other places or sectors? Robustness  Given inherent uncertainty about the future, will the action perform under a range of potential  conditions?  Is it a flexible adaptation action? Can it be modified at a future date if the climate changes  differently than expected?  Are you putting all your eggs in one basket, or is this action part of a coordinated set of actions?  Is it a no-regrets action? Is it just a good idea regardless of how climate might change?   Is it a win-win action? Would it also be a good strategy for achieving other desired social,  environmental or economic results?  Are there any circumstances where you would become sorry you implemented this action? These six tests can have many parts and the tests are not simple pass/fail questions. You are trying  to find actions that are desirable as well as effectiveand you want to avoid problematic actions.  These screening tests are really about deciding whether an action is unsuitable or appropriate for your  organization. Record your conclusions in Table 8b-1 and note whether you are willing to proceed with  each action.", "97": "Reviewing the screening assessment Not every action will pass all the tests. You truly do not want to implement actions that will not work,  that you cannot afford, or that cause other problems, but be alert for ways to compensate for those  problems. Which tests an action fails matter.BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 85 Step 8b  If you disqualified an action because you cannot afford it, you might be able to transfer that risk  to others who can pay the costs. Alternatively you may need to focus attention on finding the  funds.  If the impediments are political or structural, then your first acts toward reducing a risk may be to  find ways to overcome those obstacles.  If an action generates unwanted effects, then those tradeoffs might be mitigated too. You may not be able to find any actions for some risks.  If you cannot find a single mitigating action for a risk that passes your screening tests and that you  want to implement, then a potential partner probably will not find one either, so transferring this  risk may not work. You probably need to accept or avoid the risk.   Keep track of actions that failed one or more of the screening tests because conditions may  change over time and these actions may become more attractive in the future. The best actions will pass each screening question. Actions that do satisfactorily on your tests will move  forward for further consideration of their risk reduction potential in the rest of this step.  Risk-based ranking of actions This Workbook assumes (as expressed in the Introduction) that users will have to prioritize response  actions because not all can be implemented. The mitigating actions that pass the six criteria will address  a variety of risks that will affect different goals, that will occur in different habitat types, and that range  from high-impact risks (red in your matrix) to low-impact risks (green).  In a risk management process, the best actions will be the ones that achieve the most risk reduction.  Your task now is to sort all of your screened actions according to how much of your climate change risk  they will mitigate. For each action, you first need to return to the C/P matrix and see whether the primary target of the  action is a red, yellow or green risk. Do a rough sort of your list so that actions that respond to red risks  are at the top, and actions that respond only to green risks are at the bottom (Figure 8b-2, left). What follows is a set of decision-making guidelines that will help you refine the rough sorting. Some  actions are more attractive because they respond to your organizations total risk better than others, and  they should float higher on your list. Note that a group of actions can be assessed as one coordinated  set. Your C/P matrix and the information you developed about the action in Step 8a will help you to  construct the ranking.  Actions that address red risks  Responding to red risks should be at the top of the list. You said these risks are highly likely to  happen and will have high impacts when they do. Actions that would mitigate a red risk should  get priority over responses to a yellow risk.  Actions that reduce more than one risk are more attractive than comparable ones that reduce  only one risk. Be sure the main target risk is making real movement to the lower left of your  matrix. Do not do a little bit for a red risk just because it also does a little for a yellow risk: focus  on meaningfully reducing risk.  Actions that would move red risks closer to the lower left corner of your matrix are more attractive  than comparable actions that would leave them further away. But do not spend a fortune to  mitigate risks down to zero if getting them into the green zone is sufficient.BEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 86 Step 8b  Do not duplicate efforts unless you intend to. You should not expend resources to implement  more than one solitary action to achieve the same risk reduction, but if an action is part of  a coordinated set of risk reducing actions, that is fine. If an action is part of a planned set of  redundant actions, that is fine too. Actions that address yellow risks  Yellow risks should not be the primary target of your efforts unless you have no red risks. Look for  opportunities to move yellow risks into the green zone as part of your work on other red risks.  You may have an opportunity to take an action that would reduce a few yellow risks instead  of taking another action that would reduce one red risk. This is a judgment call based on the  magnitude of all the contextual benefits each choice could achieve. However, do not work to  clean out the yellow zone while leaving red risks intact. Actions that only address green risks  Actions that respond only to green risks should be at the bottom of your list. You have decided  these risks are less likely to occur and would not matter as much if they did. You probably should  not dedicate any resources to them that would take away from responding to yellow or red risks.   Actions that have negligible costs (in time and money) and can be taken as a part of other normal  business are more attractive than other actions aimed at green risks.  Instead of launching a project aimed at a green risk, look for opportunities to fine-tune an  action you will use to address a red or yellow risk. Maybe those actions can incorporate a small  component that further reduces green risks. After you assess your pool of actions, you should have a relative ranking (like the example on the right  side of Figure 8b-1) of the whole set of actions based on how much of your organizations overall risk they  reduce. This is a risk-based ordering of actions.  Selecting actions for implementation You are setting out to reduce the overall climate change  risk to your organization. A risk-based ordering of actions  means that each action (or coordinated set of actions)  reduces more risk than the item below it on the list. If  you moved actions to be out of sequence on the list  (either further up or further down), then some actions that  reduce less risk would appear higher on your list than  actions that reduce more risk. If you need to prioritize response actions because you will  not be able to implement them all, the next thing is to  divide your actions into two tiers. Tier 1 actions are the  ones your organization has the capacity to start on within  your workplan cycle. Tier 2 is the waiting list. Taking into  account your organizations financial and human  resources, you should draw a line separating the actions into Tier 1 and Tier 2 as far down from the top  of the list as you can in order to maximize the number of actions in Tier 1 (Figure 8b-2). If Tier 1 reaches down to an action that you cannot afford but you can afford more actions below that  particularly expensive one, then: (1) note that one action is too costly and that you are skipping it in this", "98": "work planning cyclebut dont change its place in the ordered listand (2) move the line down so that  as many actions as you can afford are in Tier 1. The actions in Tier 1 generate the most risk reduction you can realize at this time. Tier 1 actions will move  into Step 9 for implementation. The actions that are beyond your current capacity will be in Tier 2 and  will not move forward right now. Actions that you skip are technically in Tier 2, but keep their place in the  ordered list.", "99": "Concept approval In Step 7, you may have worked with your partners to negotiate a transfer of certain risks. You may also  have decided to run some risks by choosing to accept them. You may have decided to avoid some risks.  You decided to try to mitigate the remaining risks. You also confirmed with your key decision-makers that  they concur with the high-level approach for each risk. In Step 8b, you selected promising adaptation  actions for all the risks you intend to mitigate, and you are proposing to move that set forward for project  design and implementation. Before you go further with your action plan, this is another opportunity to  run it by your organization board of directors, management committee, staff, and the people who are  regularly involved in decisions for their concurrence about how you propose to manage your risks. A planning-level plan In this last planning-level step, you will create the  mechanisms to ensure that you make progress. You want  to create two risk management tracking systems. One  tracks the actions; the other tracks the risks. You will create  two tables that start as inverses of each other. Each table  should be updated regularly. The first table (Table 9-1) tracks the actions and notes  which risks they are associated with as well as who has  responsibility for implementing them. An action may  address more than one risk.

As time passes, your context may change, so your plan  will need to be adjusted to suit these changes. Your  organization may take on new challenges and have new  goals. Your budget or personnel may change. Perhaps the  political situation in which you operate evolves. Or maybe  you identify more partners to transfer risks tofreeing up  more resources and time for you to address other risks.  In any case, you will need to review and revise your action  plan to reflect changes in your regulatory, political and  financial context and ensure the plan reflects your current  context. Climate change: New climate change science will likely emerge after you have completed your  adaptation plan. Information about magnitude of projected changes and new knowledge about  expected impacts will continue to be improved. Incorporate new information (e.g., science, data) as it  becomes available so that your plan stays current and effectively addresses your risks.

End of sidebarBEING PREPARED FOR CLIMATE CHANGE | 99 Step 10 Risks: Your risks will likely evolve over time as well,  especially as climate changes accumulate or interact. What  used to be a moderate risk could become a more severe  risk over time, one you feel needs to be addressed sooner  rather than later. Your own mitigating actions hopefully  change how you would assess a risk, too. Update your plan  to reflect changes and continue through the subsequent  steps to revise your action plan.  Action plan: Your action plan is meant to be a living  document.

In step 4, the assessment team uses the information in the table to analyze the overall economic  implications for the community. In this step, the team develops a comprehensive picture of local  economic risks and opportunities associated with climate change.

For example, in the Northeast region, the  assessment notes that, Between 1895 and 2011,  temperatures in the Northeast increased by  almost 2F (0.16F per decade), and precipitation  increased by approximately five inches, or more  than 10 percent (0.4 inches per decade). Coastal  flooding has increased due to a rise in sea level  of approximately 1 foot since 1900. 1 These  trends are projected to continue (Figure 5)", "126": "C. Climate Change Impacts on Local Economies  Communities can face many stressors, such as rapid population increases or losses, aging public  infrastructure, economic fluctuations, volatile or unpredictable energy prices, and natural  hazards. Climate change is likely to exacerbate many of these challengesfor example, by  damaging infrastructure, which requires more frequent repair and maintenance and costs local  and state governments more money, or changing environmental conditions in ways that affect  local industries such as fisheries or tourism. A resilient community will continue to thrive in the  face of those stressors.  A resilient community will also find ways to adapt its economy to opportunities that arise from  the changing climate. Opportunities could come from changing consumer preferences,  consumption patterns, demands for new products and services (including those that are climate  resilient), major public infrastructure engineering and construction, and alternative supply chain  services.  Businesses that can operate with minimal interruption during and after extreme weather events  could have a competitive advantage over less-prepared companies. Similarly, communities that  help their businesses prepare and protect their transportation, utilities, and other essential assets  and services could be more attractive to businesses looking for more secure locations.

Community economic development leaders are often interested in longer  range projections to have time to plan for anticipated trends, while individual businesses might  want to look 15 or 30 years into the future, depending on their product or service and lease or  ownership status. The team can consider the objectives and resources that it established in step 1  and select the most appropriate scenarios.  If the community does not have a completed climate vulnerability assessment or other related  studies from which to draw, the team will need to determine what it will use based on how it  intends to obtain climate impact information and what is available.  For the basic approach, communities with no climate change projections for their geographic  area can use regional scenarios developed for the National Climate Assessment and tools from  federal agencies and nongovernmental groups to get a general sense of impacts likely to occur in  their region (see appendix C for links to resources). Some states have more regionally specific  climate change projections, and some regions have also developed finer-grained projections. For  the moderate or advanced approach, the team can work with climate change specialists to  develop finer-grained projections for the community. Many universities have climate change  specialists who could help conduct more in-depth analyses of local climate change projections.  To ensure it can explain and defend the assumptions underlying the assessment, the team should  document the climate change scenarios it selected and why (e.g., data availability or relationship  to the community goals and objectives). The team should keep in mind, however, that just as  communities use demographic, economic, and other estimates and projections in planning and  decision-making, it can use a plausible future scenario such as those described in the National  Climate Assessment as a reasonable basis for the assessment.

The team can summarize the projections of  the depth of the water and the geographic boundary of the inundation area from  the various tools or studies it uses for the selected scenarios. Flood and storm surge: The team can determine the boundaries of the areas  where water is expected to temporarily inundate land to a specific, problematic  depth during or immediately after a storm. Extreme heat and drought: In most cases, the spatial gradient for temperature  and drought conditions will be very low or unnoticeable at the local scale.

It is not necessary to spend a great deal of time refining  this scale. The important thing is to have a consistent basis for distinguishing where climate- related hazards pose the greatest risk to the local economy. The sample assessment form uses high, moderate, low, and none as a scale to help  estimate and compare assets vulnerability to various climate impacts. The team could establish  ranges for each level; for example, a low level of risk might be that 1 to 5 percent of the asset  category could be affected by the climate hazard, a moderate level could be 5 to 20 percent, and  a high level could be more than 20 percent. To bracket the ranges, the team could consider  factors such as value of the assets, potential for collateral impact (i.e., dependence of other  economic activities on those assets), or similar concerns. Ultimately, the team can use whatever  scale it wants based on the communitys context and threats.  Once the team has defined a scale, it can apply it to each identified asset for each climate  change-related hazard.

While these programs often focus on residential properties, some buyout programs include business properties, especially when recent disasters severely affected business districts. When considering whether to include business property owners in a buyout program, a community needs to weigh the total benefits of the buyout with total costs, including the loss of tax revenue if that business relocates outside of the community. The community would want to consider whether the businesses will ever come back, and if not, if the buyout program could help them find another place in the community.

Cisterns capture rainwater to reuse  for irrigation, saving money on water bills  (Figures 27 and 28). Green roofs also  capture runoff and insulate the building,  helping to reduce heating and cooling bills (Figure 29). Adding green infrastructure  elements to parking lots, which along with  roofs are often the largest expanses of  impervious area on a development site, can  reduce stormwater runoff significantly while  also making the lot more attractive and  cooler (Figure 30). Preserving and planting  trees in new development or redevelopment  sites can similarly slow rainfall while  cooling and cleaning the air. Sometimes, incorporating these practices  into a site design can add time and money;  however, it could save both in the event of a  heavy rain storm by reducing runoff,  ponding, and local flooding. Often, if  incorporated into the early site design, green  infrastructure practices can reduce overall  infrastructure development costs.

For example, Recover Green Roofs, a small business in Somerville, Massachusetts, designs,  installs, and maintains green roofs.45  Companies that might be able to move into a climate-related market could conduct formal market research that considers not just past demand but growth projections. Analyze local markets or markets in which the firm already works for entry opportunities. Firms that do not work in a sector that serves a climate market could assess the soft returns on leadership in resilience, such as community or national recognition.  Identify regional innovation hubs working on vulnerabilities in your industry (e.g., materials or shipping solutions), and explore opportunities to partner or pilot technologies or practices. These collaborations could occur with universities, private incubators and accelerators, and small business technology initiatives.  Build relationships with firms doing complementary work in climate-related markets to build a base for partnerships (e.g., through networking events among entities working in this area). A regional cluster in a field of interest provides agglomeration benefits, like innovation opportunities and workforce availability, that can help firms become competitive, particularly firms that are poised to be first to market.

Assemble a Steering Committee To develop an effective sea level rise adaptation plan that reflects  the expertise and interests of the communitys local stakeholders, a  steering committee should be assembled to assist the organization  responsible for writing the plan. Steering committees have the ability  to enhance all ensuing activities in the adaptation planning process.  Because they have a large role in providing data and implementing  actions, local government officials or champions are the best candi- dates to chair or lead the steering committee or working group for the  planning process. However, steering committees can accomplish their  ultimate purpose, to engage the whole community, if they also include  non-governmental representation with strong ties to the community  (e.g., businesses, non-profits, and neighborhood groups", "228": "It is recommended that the planning team recruit a steering commit- tee whose composition is a blend of community champions, knowl- edgeable community development officials, and technical experts that  understand flooding and coastal dynamics. In addition to guidance,  steering committee members may work directly with the adaptation  planning team to write the adaptation plan so that components such  as the Vulnerability Assessment and Adaptation Strategies follow pro- fessional standards. Because sea level rise adaptation planning is an  emerging topic, DEP and NOAA urge communities to think of sources  of technical assistance in organizations that routinely address the sub- ject. Universities and their cadres of graduate students, Florida Sea  Grant agents, regional planning council staff, and NOAA Coastal Man- agement Fellows are some examples.  ", "229": "The planning team is encouraged to look to the private sector (e.g., green  building contractors, engineering firms experienced with flood issues),  non-profits (e.g., 1000 Friends of Florida, The Nature Conservancy),  and universities for potential steering committee members. Coastal  biologists, geologists, engineers, public finance specialists, researchers,  and residents with local knowledge may all be able to support adapta- tion planning endeavors. By strategically populating the steering com- mittee, the ensuing activities in the adaptation planning process may  benefit from creative ideas. Another source for steering committee  members can be local mitigation steering committees, floodplain man- agement planning committees, and other similar groups. Participation  by these committees in adaptation planning may even earn the com- munity a bonus in their respective planning processes. The Community  Rating System (CRS) Activity 412.d (Higher study standards) awards  additional credits if the community shows areas that are predicted to  be susceptible to flooding in the future because of climate change or  sea level rise. For this activity, the community must use an estimate  of the anticipated sea level rise that is at least as high as the NOAA  intermediate-high projections for 2100. Thus, involving local flood- plain managers may result in earning CRS points.", "230": "1.2. Set Guiding Principles and Motivations  By determining guiding principles and motivations, the community can  establish its compass for navigating through the remaining components  of the planning process. The guiding principles and motivations are one  of the plans most interactive sub-components and should assist deci- sion-making activities in the subsequent components (i.e., Vulnerability  Assessment, Adaptation Strategies, and Implementation Strategies). The communitys guiding principles and motivations for sea level rise  adaptation planning should be set by the plan development team and  the steering committee. The principles and motivations examine how  the community operates and set its vision for the future which leads  to planning goals. Convening a group to set the overarching goals is  one primary method for identifying and organizing guiding forces into  a single planning process. The principles may align well with goals, and  motivations can be aligned as objectives to meet one or more goals.  Setting goals is also a part of the comprehensive planning process and  Local Mitigation Strategy process (see 44 CFR 201.6 (c)(3)(i)), which are  both recognized at the state and federal level as an important step in  facilitating hazard planning efforts. Communities should ensure that  the goals of their adaptation plan fit well within the goals set by other  planning mechanisms such as their Local Mitigation Strategy, Post-Di- saster Redevelopment Plan, Comprehensive Plan, Historic Preserva- tion Plan, and others if applicable. If the goals from different plans  conflict, then the implementation phase will likely be difficult and may  reach an impasse.", "231": "1.3. Describe the Geographic Context Describing the geographic context delineates the boundaries of the plan- ning area and the assets, buildings, and structures contained therein.  It is important for the planning team to contextualize the physical loca- tion for which a community is planning. Describing the geographic con- text should include maps with the location of the community within  the larger region as well as topographical, hydrological, and zoning  layers that indicate current limitations and opportunities for develop- ment activities. The maps and information developed in this plan sub-component  should support the activities within the Vulnerability Assessment com- ponent. As presented in the Exposure Analysis (see Chapter 2.1) and  Sensitivity Analysis (see Chapter 2.2), maps of the community showing  potential sea level rise are a crucial piece of information for the adap- tation planning process", "232": "1.4. Identify Opportunities for Community  Participation Community members beyond the steering committee should par- ticipate to shape the outcome of the planning process. Examples of  targeted participation opportunities include holding focus group  meetings, conducting workshops, and addressing the topic during  neighborhood gatherings, home owner association meetings, and  town hall (general public) meetings as well as multi-media events such  as broadcasts and surveys. An effective example of Community Partici- pation in a sea level rise planning effort is to walk through a Strengths,  Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analysis to outline  issues more systematically. Participation activities such as these can  help to build and strengthen stakeholder and community support for  the project as well as serve to highlight concern areas that the plan- ning team may not have previously considered or addressed.", "233": "1.4.1. Stakeholder Identification Stakeholders, those local individuals from a variety of organizations  with interest in community planning and the shaping of the future, are  best identified by determining who and what the planning efforts will  affect.

Utilizing a community outreach strategy, as described  further below, will pull in the most appropriate stakeholders.", "234": "It is the responsibility of the local government officials and the steering  committee to lead the efforts of stakeholder engagement by deter- mining the appropriate organizations and individuals to take part in  the overall process. They must decide on the best option for promot- ing and fostering engagement based on the target audience. Individu- als and groups from all levels of government, including federal, state,  and tribal groups, as well as representative groups from across the  community should be offered the opportunity to participate. Outreach  to vulnerable populations should also be a priority, so they have the  opportunity to participate in the planning process and become vested  in activities that could directly affect them.", "235": "Local Government Officials5 Stakeholder engagement should include local executive-level staff like  elected officials, other local departments with a role in adaptation,  and/or neighboring communities. Local executive staff can bring polit- ical awareness to the planning process that can be a boost to public  engagement. Other departments may have technical or project expe- rience in fields related to adaptation like coastal flooding. In addition,  the planning, zoning, stormwater, and public works departments may  create project scope and manage implementable projects that result  from the planning effort. This guidance during strategic development  will assist future project implementation. Neighboring community  stakeholders may be able to enlighten the community by sharing their  own adaptation or mitigation experience.", "236": "Community Organizations and Leaders  Community organizations and leaders comprise an additional stake- holder group to engage. Connections can be made by reviewing  their event calendars and meeting agendas to find a time and way to  introduce the adaptation planning process and enlist their involve- ment. Potential partners may include church groups, rotary clubs,  civic organizations, homeowners associations, and specific interest  groups. Community partnerships can provide support and local buy-in  to adaptation and resiliency planning efforts. To increase stakeholder  engagement, it is well served to utilize existing community activities  and forums where individuals are already involved.  ", "237": "Major Businesses The local business community has a vested interest in the long-term  success of the overall community and is a natural stakeholder to the  forward-looking adaptation planning process. These businesses may  be directly impacted by sea level rise or work in an industry like real  estate where their book of business may be impacted. Local busi- nesses, especially those that are water dependent or benefit from  coastal proximity, can provide an additional support dimension and  help spread the word as well as provide resources. The insurance  industry is often absent from these discussions but also has a very  valuable perspective.", "238": "1.4.2. Public Outreach Approach Public participation is important for identifying social, cultural, eco- nomic, and physical factors, which need to be considered during the  establishment of guiding principles used to develop community adap- tation strategies. It is also the appropriate avenue for socializing the  plan. When local ideas, concerns, and preferences are considered,  adaptation strategies can be tailored to meet community needs and  desires. Plans and policy that are developed with broad stakeholder  participation are more likely to be well-received and gain public support  when residents have participated in the process from the start. While  some members of the public may not welcome the process initially,  walking them through the various components generally helps estab- lish valid and urgent reasons why sea level rise adaptation is needed.", "239": "General Public Often, members of the public have had experiences in the past that  can significantly contribute to discussions of vulnerabilities and adap- tation possibilities. The wealth of knowledge in the local community  should not be discounted, and every effort should be made to gather  it and use it. The first step is education and awareness, allowing individuals to truly  understand the threats of sea level rise and flooding based on the  effects of total water level. Efforts to educate local stakeholders on  current and future flood hazards can be enhanced by directly engag- ing the public using nontraditional outreach techniques, such as social  media and interviews. Looking ahead, todays youth will be the ones inheriting the full brunt  of sea level rise, greater storm surge events, and extreme precipitation  that leads to devastating floods. Future generations will continue the  task of addressing these climate issues, and some individuals will likely  embrace involvement. Youth can help contribute their skill with things  like social media to enhance the outreach effort. They also can bring  energy, a fresh perspective, dedication to shaping their future, and  willingness to think outside the box to help find innovative ideas and  concepts to advance adaptation planning.", "240": "Community conversations to identify goals should be centered on topics  including:   Background information and critical risks.   The steps that can be taken to reduce risks.   Why adaptation planning efforts are important for the community.   How the proposed strategies will impact the community.   Which proposed strategies the community prefers.   Steps residents can take to assist in community adaptation efforts. In doing so, an informed set of stakeholders may be equipped to add great  value to the critical thinking behind Focus Area prioritization (see Chapter 2.3).", "241": "Outreach Strategies The success of adaptation strategies largely depends upon confidence  in the idea that reductions in long-term risk exposure, combined with  present day mitigation efforts, will be sustained. Outreach is an import- ant activity that can help build this confidence and lead to future action;  however, each communitys outreach strategy will be unique to reflect  local conditions. To ensure that adaptation is well received in the com- munity, simply posting information on the citys website is a first step  although it will not be adequate on its own. Positive public informa- tion efforts that outline what people can do are more likely to impact  behavior. It is not enough that people know they are in a hazardous  area; they need to want to do something about it. Community mem- bers must understand the effects each strategy will have on them and  what actions they can take. Therefore, messaging is very important.  ", "242": "A key public engagement approach is to shift from telling towards  asking about what should be done. Residents are deeply connected  to where they live, and crowdsourcing information can add a new layer  to components like the Vulnerability Assessment (e.g., allow citizens to  tell their personal experiences of how their homes, streets, or the busi- nesses they frequent have been impacted by king tides and pinpoint  these locations on a map with a tag describing the impact).", "243": "It is important to prepare for outreach  and create specific content areas. A com- munity with a proactive outreach strategy  that speaks to specific community social  and political views will have a greater  chance of moving beyond informing to  prompting community members to act.  Determining the different stakeholder  views will lend itself to a more tailored  and appropriate outreach strategy, a chal- lenging task. As part of an early outreach  strategy, it is recommended to incorporate  a chart of the recorded sea levels for the  nearest NOAA tide gauge over the last 50  to 75 years to represent the historic sea  level rise trend. This action should help  establish evidence-based reasons for  approaching adaptation, help get beyond  personal opinions, and start a process of  deeper community conversations about  what to do about sea level rise.", "244": "The following table details a spectrum of stakeholder participation methods, ranging from in-person to internet communication. The planning team is  encouraged to evaluate which method may work best at each of the six public participation points of the adaptation planning process. Method Description Advisory group/task  force Small group of people representing various interests set up to give advice on programs or actions. In this planning process, an  advisory group of more technically oriented individuals may be appropriate for something like Exposure Analysis. App A program that operates on a smartphone. Could be used to poll, disseminate information, or provide services. Charrette Intense, single or even multi-day effort to design something or solve a problem. Field trip Trip to specific location organized so that participants can match mental images to real conditions. Focus group Small discussion group led by a facilitator who draws out in-depth stakeholder input on specific questions. Hotline Widely advertised telephone number that directs callers to someone who can answer questions and collect input. Interview Face-to-face or telephone interaction with stakeholders conducted by the agency or by a third-party representative. Large group/small  group meeting Opening presentation then division into smaller groups to discuss an issue or complete a task. Open house  Event in which the public is invited to visit a location with staffed booths or stations. These stations could include areas with  maps (either paper maps or computer stations) facilitated by the meeting organizers staffed with various subject matters  experts. Poll or Survey Written or oral lists of questions to solicit community impressions/facts about issues at a specific moment in time. Public hearing Formal, single meeting where stakeholders present official statements and positions that are recorded. Public meeting Large public comment meeting where comments are made to entire audience. Referendum A direct vote by the whole electorate on its support of specific proposals. Retreat Concentrated, informal meeting that emphasizes social interaction as well as issue discussion. Social media Information and interactive event and issue marketing carried out through web and app platforms such as Facebook, Twitter,  and Instagram. Story map An interactive, web-based map that provides enhanced information about locations. Town hall meeting Less formal public hearing where stakeholders have the opportunity to speak and/or vote. Website An online resource center that may provide (on the front end) information, interactive data, feedback mechanisms, and (on the  back end) analytics to administrators.

Best Practices in Stakeholder Involvement Best practices in stakeholder involvement and participation are deter- mined by the principles established at the beginning of the planning  process and are the preferred end result of the chosen strategy.  Depending on the type of audience and engagement, the best possible  techniques for stakeholder involvement will vary. All of the best prac- tice strategies may not be applicable for each stage in the adaptation  planning process, but all are factors that can shape how community  involvement may be designed.

This is a step-by-step methodology presented in a logical  sequence that will help lead a community to priority actions and pri- ority areas. The Exposure Analysis visually represents the potential  encroachment of the sea into land areas, and the Sensitivity Analysis illustrates the variety of entities that may be affected by a rise. Each  community may adapt the Exposure and Sensitivity Analyses to suit  their own priorities. With these analyses in hand, the community can  turn its decision making toward assigning Focus Areas. Focus Areas constitute the selected locations where the Adaptation Strategies  component will direct its attention.", "248": "To ultimately write an adaptation plan that reflects the expertise and  interests of the communitys local stakeholders, public involvement  should be included at each step. Community members need to know  about the potential threat of coastal flooding, and they need to know  concrete information about the planning being done to confront it.  Early introduction of sea level rise visualization tools can indicate the  great level of detail that scientists have already committed to project- ing and mapping future change and can be very tangibly felt when  shown in a specific community. Integrating testimonials of those who  have perceived experience with sea level rise can contribute to the  authenticity and local focus of the process. Longtime residents of an  area may contribute valuable information about lost barrier islands or  coastal areas where they once recreated or did business. Often vulner- abilities are brought out by community members that are not evident  from mapping and studies.", "249": "2.1. Conduct an Exposure Analysis An Exposure Analysis uses a sea level  rise projection to answer the ques- tion where qualified by two factors   when (what time horizon  e.g., 10  years, 25 years) and how much (which  sea level rise scenario  e.g., 1-foot  inundation). The where will depend  on which computer model is used (e.g., Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model  (SLAMM); Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH)) to  produce the sea level rise projection. The analysis can depict which areas  in the community are likely to be susceptible to the chosen sea level rise  scenario on a map. There are a variety of methods that can be used to project sea level  rise. These methods range from extrapolating a straight line into the  future based upon historically recorded sea level heights from the  nearest NOAA gauge station to predicting a curve of accelerating sea  level heights based upon Global Climate Model projections. To consoli- date these methods and projections, a number of sea level rise viewing  tools have been created to help visualize the effects of sea level rise on  communities. Examples of these tools are described and categorized  below in Chapter 2.4 and Best Practices are identified in Chapter 2.5.", "250": "Sea Level Affecting Marshes Model  (SLAMM", "251": "Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes (SLOSH)", "252": "Sea level rise viewing tools generally employ different projection data  and levels of resolution (the grid cell size of Digital Elevation Model;  e.g., 2 feet x 2 feet versus 20 feet x 20 feet) to generate a visual expo- sure projection. This projection shows the areas that will be inundated  by future sea level rise. The tools may also measure impacts on dif- ferent categorizations of land. The tools function using different soft- ware. If available, the planning team and community would benefit  from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software when generating  its own exposure map.  Planning teams are encouraged to use the tool that has the highest res- olution (e.g., most elevation readings per unit-area of land) to increase  accuracy. Previous Florida sea level rise assessments have shown that  achieving the highest resolution in a sea level rise tool may require  in-house or contracted specialist GIS work to produce a map of expo- sure specific to the community. The team is also encouraged to use a  software program that meshes well with the way in which the commu- nity currently plans (for instance, when the community prepares to do  a Sensitivity Analysis, leveraging assets already mapped in a GIS layer  from past planning projects saves time and increases accuracy).", "253": "2.2. Conduct a Sensitivity Analysis This Sensitivity Analysis sub-com- ponent builds upon the Exposure  Analysis and is usually conducted  utilizing the same tool that was  used to make the exposure map.  Conducting a Sensitivity Analysis  helps the community to identify  natural resources, structures,  populations, and other features located in areas that are at risk in the  sea level rise scenario projected during Exposure Analysis.  Sensitivity can be defined as the responsiveness of a system to haz- ard impacts.8 The Sensitivity Analysis serves as the opportunity for the  planning team and its steering committee to identify the land uses,  buildings, resources, and people affected by the potential sea level  rise projected by the Exposure Analysis. By mapping all entities in the  communitys jurisdiction, the planning team develops a basic repre- sentation of which entities have the potential to be affected by sea  level rise.  ", "254": "The planning team may introduce and analyze new layers of structural  and population sensitivity by including various characteristics in the  Sensitivity Analysis mapping. For buildings, this may include physical  characteristics that will better respond to sea level rise, such as raised,  floodable, and anchored structures. For natural areas, this may include  information about wildlife, ecosystems, floodplains, water tables, and  industry-supporting habitats (such as oyster coves). For populations,  this can include social demographics, such as household size and  income by census tract. Examples of Best Practices are identified in  Chapter 2.5.", "255": "2.3. Assign Focus Areas With the assistance of the steering  committee and community stake- holders, the planning team may  assign Focus Areas. This sub-com- ponent builds on the identification  of sensitive entities in the previous  step and assigns community pref- erences to areas that will receive a  majority of the adaptation strategy attention. The Focus Areas help  the community designate areas to start their adaptation process and  narrow the field to build a track record of implementation. Deciding on Focus Areas is a step where the planning team engages  the community to address the findings from the Exposure and Sensi- tivity Analyses. It is recommended that before the Vulnerability Assess- ment begins, criteria be established to guide the publics input (e.g.,  Focus Areas are established where critical facilities or infrastructure  are located and/or where the highest affected population resides).  To do this, it is important to convey information about the potential  affected entities to both steering committee members and community  stakeholders and to record their feedback about what should become  a Focus Area and why. Preferential areas which receive steering com- mittee and community attention may then be deemed Focus Areas  that can benefit from adaptation strategies directed toward them  using the following components.", "256": "Deciding on Focus Areas is a step where the planning team engages  the community to address the findings from the Exposure and Sensi- tivity Analyses.

Preferential areas which receive steering com- mittee and community attention may then be deemed Focus Areas  that can benefit from adaptation strategies directed toward them  using the following components.", "257": "Climate Centrals Surging Seas", "258": "FDOT Sea Level Scenario Sketch  Planning Tool", "259": "The Nature Conservancy Coastal  Resilience Mapping Portal", "260": "NOAA Sea Level Rise Viewer", "261": "NOAA Sea Level Trends", "262": "Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI)  (University of South Carolina, Hazard  and Vulnerability Research Institute)", "263": "USGS National Assessment of Coastal  Vulnerability to Sea Level Rise: Coastal  Vulnerability Index (CVI)", "264": "USGS Digital Shoreline Analysis System  (DSAS)", "265": "ADvanced CIRCulation Model (ADCIRC)  (University of North Carolina at  Chapel Hill, University of Notre Dame,  University of Texas at Austin) ", "266": "Integrated Valuation of Environmental  Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) (Nature  Capital Project)", "267": "NatureServe Climate Change  Vulnerability Index (CCVI) ", "268": "NOAA Wave Exposure Model (WEMo)", "269": "Sea Levels Affecting Marshes Model  (SLAMM) (Warren Pinnacle Consulting,  Inc.)", "270": "Simulator of Climate Change Risks  and Adaptation Initiatives (SimCLIM)  (CLIMsystems Ltd.", "271": "USACE Sea Level Change Curve  Calculator", "272": "Coastal Adaptation to Sea Level  Rise Tool (COAST) ", "273": "NOAA Inundation Analysis Tool", "274": "U.S. DOT Vulnerability Assessment  Scoring Tool (VAST)", "275": "NOAAs Sea Level Trends visualization too", "276": "U.S. Geological Surveys (USGS) National Assessment of Coastal Vulner- ability to Sea Level Rise", "277": "The Nature Conservancy Coastal Resilience Visualization Tool", "278": "The Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI) i", "279": "The Florida Department of Transportations (FDOT) Sea Level Sce- nario Sketch Planning Tool ", "280": "The Gulf Tools for Resilience Exploration Engine (Gulf TREE) i", "281": "Gulf of Mexico Alliance Resilience Team (GOMA)", "282": "Exposure Analysis As described earlier, the Exposure Analysis sets the parameters that  will guide when and how much to find where sea level rise is likely  to occur. The Exposure Analysis process may be defined in four steps.  First, a sea level rise model is chosen. Secondly, horizon dates (e.g.,  2040, 2070) are selected to guide the models first output. Then the  model calculates static sea level rise elevations (and can also predict  other changes to local coastal landscapes) for how much sea level  rise is probable at the chosen horizon time points. Finally, future inun- dation areas are located (typically within a GIS map window). The out- put of this step is important because it generates a listing or mapping  of the coastal areas that are likely to be impacted. The Exposure Anal- ysis includes assumptions regarding the manner in which the eustatic  (the total volume of ocean water) and vertical changes in sea levels  could affect a community.Adaptation Planning Guidebook | 31 30 | Adaptation Planning Guidebook The Statewide Vulnerability Assessment Report (2014)10 recommends  utilizing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Sea Level Change  Curve Calculator coupled with static point projection of inundation.  Because point projection also generates attribute files, an accompa- nying table can be created that indicates sea level rise over the given  time period (i.e., rise amount of each project year). FDOTs Sea Level  Rise Scenario Sketch Planning Tool website includes an add-in download  that calculates sea level rise in GIS software utilizing the USACE method.  This recommendation may mean that coastal sea level rise will be pro- jected along seven delineations that reflect the seven FDOT districts. For  the planning horizon years, the report recommends that model years of  2020, 2040, 2060, 2080, and 2100 be projected to establish continuity  with the FDOT tool.

A  Sensitivity Analysis is also important to include in a Vulnerability Anal- ysis because it can answer the question: who and what will be affected  by potential sea level rise? For such an analysis, additional GIS data  layers are needed to assess where the projected inundation is likely to  affect structures, populations, conservation areas, and other entities. The Statewide Vulnerability Assessment Report (2014)11 recommends  pairing or overlaying the Exposure Analysis model outputs (i.e., GIS  data layer of coastal inundation) with all entities identified in the table  below to determine which entities are sensitive to sea level rise. This  list was compiled from two sensitivity analyses created by the South- east Florida Regional Climate Change Compact (2012)12 and Climate  Central (2014).13", "286": "Focus Areas Once the Exposure and Sensitivity Analyses have been conducted, a  community may translate these findings into map-designated areas  that constitute the boundaries of the Focus Areas. Focus Areas should  be based upon the findings generated during the Exposure and Sensi- tivity Analyses. Focus Areas can be defined on a map according to the  following characteristics: a specific geographic area (e.g., development  along coastlines), certain vulnerable populations or communities (e.g.,  the elderly and climate-related health risks), natural and built systems  (e.g., local stormwater drainage systems and infrastructure), and other  assets identified and quantified during the Sensitivity Analysis.", "287": "Funding Opportunities In addition to potential grants available through NOAA and other fed- eral and non-profit agencies (see Appendix 6.2 for examples of specific  funding programs), funding opportunities to complete a vulnerabil- ity assessment may come in the form of partnerships. A vulnerabil- ity assessment can support many local planning efforts in addition to  adaptation planning. As such, resources could be shared to support  the development of a vulnerability assessment that could be inte- grated into multiple local plans. Integrating adaptation planning into  existing local plans is discussed further, in Chapter 3.4.", "288": "2.6. Public Outreach Approach,  Communicating Risk, and Opportunities for  Community Participation Assigning the Focus Areas is an opportunity to conduct public outreach  and seek community participation in the Vulnerability Assessment  component as discussed in Chapter 2.3. The Vulnerability Analysis  public outreach, including sharing the results of the Exposure and Sen- sitivity Analyses, is an excellent forum to inform the public and stake- holders about the future risk of sea level rise and potential increased  flooding. It also provides a basis for the next round of meetings which  includes identifying mitigation strategies to address the vulnerability  (see Chapter 3).  The public should be given the chance to provide input about what  should become Focus Areas for the community. Information about  the potential encroachment of the sea into land areas and the entities  affected by a rise should be conveyed to the public during a workshop  or public meeting. Based on the feedback received from the public,  preferential areas can be determined that may be deemed Focus  Areas. The completion of this round of public outreach sets the stage  of who will be affected and to what degree to set up the adaptation  strategies.", "289": "3.1. Assess Adaptive Capacities Adaptive capacity has been defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change as the ability of a system to adjust to climate change  (including climate variability and extremes), to moderate potential  damages, to take advantage of opportunities, or to cope with the  consequences. To assess community adaptive capacity, the planning  team and steering committee are encouraged to develop a framework  to evaluate the communitys capacity to address the impacts of sea  level rise. This may include, but is not limited to, an assessment of:15 1. Regulatory and planning capabilities (e.g., protection of human  life, development and redevelopment restrictions, coastal  management regulations, hazard mitigation, sustainability,  shoreline management, post-disaster recovery/emergency  plans, infrastructure placement, and financial impacts); 2. Administrative and technical capabilities (e.g., the number of  sea level rise experts, planners, engineers, GIS and mapping  resources, and modeling capabilities); 3. Fiscal capacity (e.g., taxes, bonds, grants, impact fees, with- holding spending in hazard zones, and insurance); and 4. Infrastructure (e.g., flood and erosion control structures, evac- uation routes and redundant water, wastewater, and power  systems).", "290": "3.2. Prioritize Adaptation Needs Once the adaptive capacities of the local community have been identi- fied, a prioritization framework can follow. At this point in the planning  process, the community should be aware of the impacts of potential  sea level rise and inland flooding, have identified its focus areas to  address the impacts, and/or have inventoried the capacity of the com- munity to adapt. It is at this step that the community combines those  findings and creates a short list of its biggest challenges to determine  what can feasibly be done where and when.16 Articulating a communitys biggest challenges to sea level rise is a nec- essary step in identifying adaptation needs. For example: The most  important challenge facing the local agency is adequately address- ing the current state of the wastewater treatment plant which is at  increased risk to flooding or Elevating the many bridges in the local  agencys jurisdiction to withstand 2 feet of sea level rise is our high- est priority. Prioritizing adaptation needs sets the stage for the next  sub-component  creating specific adaptation strategies. Prioritization can be as simple as selecting the needs that can be  addressed currently (using capacities already identified as robust in the  Assess Adaptive Capacity step or categorized as low-hanging fruit)  and saving the more involved solutions for later. Conversely, it may  be more important for a local agency to tackle large-scale expected  impacts first, regardless of cost and complication, due to urgency", "291": "3.3. Identify Adaptation Strategies  Once major needs and priorities are defined, specific adaptation strat- egies can be developed, vetted, and defined. It is very important to  note that many options are available when an area is projected to be  flooded, either permanently or intermittently. A community can select  from a wide range of adaptation strategies in the following categories:  Protection, Accommodation, Retreat, and Avoidance. ", "292": "Protection strategies involve both hard and soft (or gray and  green) structurally defensive measures to mitigate impacts of rising  seas while leaving the vulnerable structures behind these measures  largely unaltered. Seawalls, revetments, and levees are examples of  hard or gray protection strategies, while beach nourishment, oyster  reef restoration, and living shorelines are all examples of green protec- tion strategies.", "293": "Accommodation strategies alter physical design to allow the structure  or land use to stay in place. Examples of this are floodable develop- ment, floating structures, and increased stormwater storage via imple- mentation of Low Impact Development or Green infrastructure (LID/ GI) in upstream locations. LID/GI upstream improvements reduce  downstream flows by allowing more stormwater to infiltrate in place,  thereby taking the pressure off the existing downstream stormwater  infrastructure. In the Netherlands, a concept known as Room for the  River helps dictate land use compatible with periodic flooding being  designated adjacent to all major Dutch rivers.  ", "294": "Retreat from areas or infrastructure where protection or accommoda- tion will not be efficient or effective can be voluntary, incentivized, or  done gradually. It can also involve new building designs in vulnerable  areas to be altered or moved when appropriate in the future. Com- munities can also plan for an eventual retreat from barrier islands and  coastal high hazard areas but, in the meantime, continue to invest  in assets in a limited fashion based on that assets expected lifetime  and projected inundation. It is important to note that communication  about retreat can be difficult. The language used to convey adaptation  strategies can make a difference in how communities react to propos- als. The term retreat often conveys a defeat, which can deter stake- holders from embracing the strategy. They may instead fight it. Other  possible terms to use include managed relocation and realign- ment. Home buyout programs, rolling easements, and land swaps are  a few possible mechanisms that communities can investigate in order  to implement managed retreat. There is also a growing body of case  law in this arena.", "295": "Avoidance involves guiding new development away from areas that  are subject to coastal hazards and can be done by implementing pol- icy and/or offering of incentives. Since capital infrastructure is devel- oped and maintained for a relatively long lifespan, planning for future  changes in sea level should be a part of initial design or incorporated  when plans are due for periodic update. City and County Land Devel- opment Regulations and Codes, as well as zoning regulations, can be  used to direct development and redevelopment to more suitable areas  where flooding and erosion are less troublesome. See Chapter 3.6 for  information about Transfer of Development Rights (TDR), another  strategy for avoidance.", "296": "Adaptation Action Areas  a State Planning Tool The designation of Adaptation  Action Areas (AAAs) is a compre- hensive planning tool that has been  available since 2011 with the pas- sage of the Community Planning  Act by the Florida legislature. An  optional but highly recommended  tool for adaptation strategies, AAAs  lend themselves to a flexible form  of zoning overlay that delineates  the physical areas where certain measures, restrictions, or prioritized  funding would apply. It is especially beneficial to designate AAAs now  because local agencies currently have the option to devise criteria  for their designation and the flexibility to edit them as circumstances  change. In many instances the 2018 FIRM update expands FEMA-des- ignated floodplains, however, in places where they are being reduced,  the need for AAAs is especially urgent. These areas are still vulnerable  to flooding, but property owners who have the option to drop flood  insurance will likely do so", "297": "Adaptation  Action Areas (AAAs)", "298": "Selection of Strategies In coordination with public input (which is described in greater detail in  Chapter 3.7), the planning team assesses the relative merits and costs  of each adaptation strategy within a given focus area to prioritize the  preferred adaptation strategy. This may be accomplished through a ben- efit-cost analysis, alternatives analysis, stakeholder feedback, or even  new output from a tool utilized during the Vulnerability Assessment.  Communities that have already gone through this process have also  identified the value of doing a business as usual baseline assessment18 that will help compare the costs anticipated by the adaptation strategies.  While adaptation strategies carry a cost, sometimes a significant one,  in the long run a benefit-cost analysis may show that properly planned  adaptation yields a tremendous savings as compared to doing nothing.", "299": "3.4. Integrate into Existing Plans Adaptation Planning outcomes are very effective when integrated into  specific local planning products. Below is a list of eight planning prod- ucts that may already exist in a local community that are appropriate  to amend with adaptation planning strategies.19 A Local Comprehensive Plan (LCP) is required of all Florida counties  and municipalities, guiding future growth and development. LCP pol- icies generally influence a communitys day-to-day land use decisions  and capital facilities expenditures. These policies play a major role in  determining local development patterns, which in turn determine the  degree to which people and property are exposed to natural hazards,  injury, and damage. Examples of communities who have already incor- porated AAAs in their LCP are included in Chapter 3.6, Best Practices. Florida local agencies are now required to integrate or add accom- modations for the 2015 Peril of Flood Statute [163.3178(2)(f) 1-6]  into their Local Comprehensive Plan. Signed into law by Governor Rick  Scott on May 21, 2015, this requirement should be contained in a new  or existing redevelopment component of their coastal management  planning element. This component should eliminate inappropriate and  unsafe development in the coastal areas when opportunities arise.", "300": "Much of the data analysis and mapping performed for a robust  response to the Peril of Flood requirement can also contribute to a  Vulnerability Assessment. The Local Mitigation Strategy (LMS) is usually developed at the county  level and serves to reduce the risks associated with natural and man- made disasters, including sea level rise. It is a connection between the  Local Comprehensive Plan, the emergency management plan, the cap- ital improvements plan, land development regulations, building codes,  and key ordinances such as those for floodplain management.  A Special Area Management Plan (SAMP) is a broad-reaching plan  providing for natural resource protection and reasonable coastal-de- pendent economic growth and contains a detailed and comprehensive  statement of policies, standards, and criteria to guide public and pri- vate uses of lands and waters as well as mechanisms for timely imple- mentation in specific geographic areas within the coastal zone. SAMPs  also provide for increased specificity in protecting natural resources,  improved protection of life and property in hazardous areas, including  those areas likely to be affected by sea level rise, as well as improved  predictability in government decision making. 16 USCS  1453 (17),  [Title 16. Conservation; Chapter 33. Coastal Zone Management]. An Economic Development Plan (EDP) provides an overview of the  economy, sets policy direction for economic growth, and identifies strat- egies, programs, and projects for improvement. These policies and strat- egies can guide future investment and economic growth or activities to  areas that are safe and that have reduced exposure to hazard risks. 20 Peril of Flood Statute. SB 1094, 2015. Florida 163.3178(2)(f) 1-6. Adaptation Planning Guidebook | 43 42 | Adaptation Planning Guidebook A post-disaster redevelopment plan (PDRP) is encouraged for all com- munities. A PDRP identifies policies, operational strategies, and roles  and responsibilities for implementation that will guide decisions that  affect long-term recovery and redevelopment of a community after a  disaster. PDRPs emphasize seizing opportunities for hazard mitigation  and community improvement consistent with the goals of the Local  Comprehensive Plan and with full participation of the citizens.  A capital improvements plan (CIP) guides the scheduling of spending  on public improvements, such as capital projects and equipment pur- chases. A CIP can serve as an important mechanism for guiding future  investments and improvements away from identified hazard areas. It  can be used to modify an existing project to add a mitigation/resilience  component. A stormwater management plan (SMP) is designed to address flood- ing associated with stormwater runoff. A stormwater management  plan is typically focused on design and construction measures that are  intended to reduce the impact of more frequently occurring but minor  (from a flooding standpoint) urban flooding that impacts water quality. A historic preservation plan (HPP) is intended to preserve historic  structures or districts within a community. An often-overlooked aspect  of the historic preservation plan is the assessment of buildings and  sites located in areas subject to natural hazards and the identification  of ways to reduce future damages.", "301": "FDOT Sea Level Scenario Sketch Planning Tool", "302": "The Nature Conservancy Coastal Resilience Mapping  Portal", "303": "NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) Land  Cover Atlas and Coastal Comparison Tool", "304": "Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI)", "305": "USGS National Assessment of Coastal Vulnerability to  Sea Level Rise: Coastal Vulnerability Index (CVI)*", "306": "USGS Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS)", "307": "ADvanced CIRCulaton Model (ADCIRC)", "308": "Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and  Tradeoffs (InVEST)", "309": "NatureServe Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI)", "310": "Sea Levels Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM)", "311": "Simulator of Climate Change Risks and Adaptation  Initiatives (SimCLIM)", "312": "USACE Sea Level Change Curve Calculator", "313": "Coastal Adaptation to Sea Level Rise Tool (COAST)", "314": "U.S. DOT Vulnerability Assessment Scoring Tool (VAST)", "315": "Adaptation Database for Planning Tool (ADAPT)", "316": "Climate Adaptation Knowledge Exchange (CAKE)", "317": "Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) Tools Network  and Database", "318": "FL DEP Map Direct Gateway", "319": "Florida Natural Areas Inventory (FNAI)", "320": "Geospatial Assessment Tool for Operations and  Response (GATOR)", "321": "U.S. Climate Resilience Toolkit", "322": "Floridas GeoPlan Sketch  Tool ", "323": "NOAAs Coastal Flood Exposure Mapper", "324": " Sea Level Rise  Viewer", "325": "Blue Marble Geographics Coastal Adaptation to  Sea Level Rise Tool", "326": "Funding Opportunities Funding opportunities to complete adaptation planning or projects  can come from a variety of sources.

Public Outreach Approach and  Opportunities for Community Participation The Adaptation Strategies step is the most solution-based part of the  Adaptation Planning process. An extensive public involvement component  is appropriate for this point and should build off the findings of the Vulner- ability Assessment. Unique local solutions are only possible when people  with different expertise and interests come together and collaborate. Structured discussion will help guide collaboration and keep the con- versation on task and productive. It is possible to delve into great  depth on particular issues and this type of detail is not always appro- priate in settings with large numbers of attendees. Questionnaires sent  to participants before the workshops that ask about their goals and  expectations for the workshop can be especially helpful as is a second  questionnaire sent after the workshop to ask participants about how  they would like to make use of the Adaptation Plan in their respective  departments.23 As learned during the pilot community projects, local officials want  to better understand their options and constraints. Knowing both the  local context as well as what has been done in other parts of Florida will  enable local officials to make informed decisions. Information pertaining  to both is appropriate to include in public materials and discussions.", "328": "Once a set of adaptation strategies has been developed and analyzed, it  is time to transition to implementation activities to move the strategies  from plan to action. This process includes identifying, preparing for, and  applying for potential funding opportunities; creating a schedule of adap- tation actions for the future; and monitoring and evaluating progress. Implementation strategies are the specific steps a community takes to  incorporate the adaptation strategies into existing planning, budgeting,  and staffing mechanisms. The Assess Adaptive Capacities sub-com- ponent (Chapter 3.1) should outline the ability of the community to  take action. Even before the Vulnerability Assessment is conducted,  communities may want to consider possible implementation strate- gies based on available capacities, existing implementation schedules,  or available funding sources. Communities must be able to support  and implement adaptation activities to successfully reduce the neg- ative impacts of potential sea level rise that were identified during a  Vulnerability Assessment. The ability to implement can increase over  time, so communities should not simply settle for what is available at  the current time but expect that, as they undertake the first round of  implementation, their knowledge and capacity will grow. The Implementation Strategies component contains most of the adap- tation plans logistics  the actions and functions that need to take  place for the product (adaptation strategies) to be delivered.

Survey of Funding Options  It is recommended that a systematic review of all known funding  sources, as well as inquiry into new funding opportunities that may  facilitate a successful implementation strategy, be completed. The availability of funds is often a key determinant as to what activi- ties could be undertaken. Funding can originate at non-profit, private,  local, state, and federal levels. It may originate from a source such  as penny sales tax, tax-increment financing, cooperative banking, or  grants. Available grants often change, but the following list identifies  agencies that may offer grants to fund adaptation strategies as well as  past and current grant examples:   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)  Office  for Coastal Management Broad Agency Announcement for  special projects   US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  P3 awards: A national  student design competition for sustainability   US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)   Community Development Block Grants Chapter 4: Implementation Strategies52 | Adaptation Planning Guidebook   Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)  Florida  Coastal Partnership Initiative   Florida Department of Economic Opportunity (DEO)  Community  Resiliency Technical Assistance Grants   Local land conservation trusts (such as the Florida Keys Environ- mental Restoration Trust Fund) The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) may also pro- vide several kinds of assistance to communities who have prepared  a local mitigation strategy that conforms to the standards set forth  in the Code of Federal Regulations (44 CR 201.6). If the community  has developed a hazard mitigation plan that is recognized by the State  (under Section 322 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emer- gency Act as amended April 2013), then some examples of applicable  FEMA funding that can be applied to coastal Protection, Accommoda- tion, and Retreat measures are as follows:   Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP)   Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM)   Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) FEMA makes the Hazard Mitigation Assistance guidance, which pro- vides the detailed information on these mitigation grant programs,  available annually. In some instances, funding can be obtained to assist  with the Vulnerability Assessment component also. Hazard Mitigation  Plans (known locally in Florida as the Local Mitigation Strategy or LMS),  which can be funded under HMGP and PDM, can also include Avoid- ance measures.", "330": "After major disasters, the Department of Housing and Urban Develop- ment (HUD) can provide mitigation grants under its Community Devel- opment Block Grant-Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program when  Congress approves a disaster supplemental. The eligible activities vary  from disaster to disaster and would be provided in the Federal Register  notice along with the State Action Plan that must be developed. In addition, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), under  the US Department of Agriculture, has two programs that may be  available to communities: the Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP)  Program and the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention (WFPO)  Program. The EWP Program is a federal emergency recovery program  available after disasters and offers assistance to communities to relieve  imminent threats to life and property caused by natural disasters that  impair a watershed. The WFPO is a cooperative program between the  federal government, states, and locals to prevent floodwater and sed- iment damage and erosion and work towards conservation of water  and land in authorized watersheds. The Florida Department of Economic Opportunity manages the Flor- ida Disaster Recovery Program and assists communities in develop- ing economic development strategies, meeting the requirements of  the Community Planning Act, addressing critical local planning issues,  and promoting innovative planning solutions to challenges identified  by local government applicants.

Deliverables must be approved by the Bureau befor", "331": "money is disbursed. The grants provide communities the opportunity  to develop innovative planning and development strategies to pro- mote a diverse economy, create vibrant rural and suburban areas,  and meet the requirements of the Community Planning Act while pro- tecting environmentally sensitive areas. In addition, the community  is encouraged to brainstorm innovative local funding ideas and plan  activities to build awareness and capacity for self-directed programs. If  a community identifies a lack of funding, a key consideration in assess- ing management priorities may be to identify and develop additional  funding resources", "332": "4.1.1. Prioritize Strategies Once a community has identi- fied Protection, Accommodation,  Retreat, and Avoidance strategies,  it may prioritize actions within its  Focus Areas. Funding should be  prioritized for adaptation activ- ities and actions, reducing risk  in the most cost-efficient way. It is important to maintain a balance  between the urgency of the moment to address current risks while  showing foresight to plan for future impacts. In several instances, it is a  minimal cost to add an additional safety margin to a project which will  also help maintain the projects effectiveness as vulnerability and risk  may increase over time. Keep in mind that many facilities and infra- structure are built to last 30 to 50 years, if not longer, and future risk  Different types of prioritization  reflect where the urgency is,  community acceptance, and  what can get the biggest bang  for the buck. It is better to  establish the criteria upfront. Chapter 4: Implementation Strategies54 | Adaptation Planning Guidebook in the latter stages of developments useful life should be factored.  Consideration of all possible options and the related costs and benefits  of each will allow for a no-regrets strategy to be designed. Priorities should be based on risks identified and potential losses as  a result of those risks and reviewed in relation to funding, ability to  implement, and consistency with other plans. FEMA and NOAA (2013)  have developed a comprehensive but quick checklist of considerations  known as STAPLEE that help evaluate each proposed action:24   Social  What are the socially acceptable adaptation strategies in  the community?   Technical  What are the technically feasible adaptation strategies  within the community?   Administrative  Which adaptation strategies are implementable  by community leadership?   Political  Which adaptation strategies are politically acceptable  within the community?   Legal  Which adaptation strategies are legally implementable by  the community under state and municipal law?   Economic  What are the cost-effective adaptation strategies avail- able to the community?   Environmental  Which adaptation strategies are most favorable  to the environment as determined by community conservation  plans and statewide guidance? By using the STAPLEE categories, a community may prioritize adapta- tion strategies that meet local capacity and preferences. The STAPLEE  method can evaluate costs in relation to benefits of implementing  one particular action over another. Using STAPLEE serves as a reality  check that helps communities avoid putting too much effort into a  type of action that has little chance of success due its particular cir- cumstances, preferences, history, and culture. An informal cost-benefit analysis can also be used to review proposed  adaptation actions. Ratings of high, medium, or low can be assigned  to the anticipated costs and the benefits associated with each action  based on general criteria that are established by the community.  Examples of ratings could include criteria such as:    High cost  existing funding is not adequate.    Medium cost  existing funding would require budget reapportionment  or amendment.   Low cost  funding available under existing budget.   High benefit  action would have a significant impact on risk reduction.   Medium benefit  action would have an impact on risk reduction.   Low benefit  long-term benefits are difficult to quantify in short term.", "333": "This methodology provides a framework for the  overall costs and benefits of each action to be con- sidered when setting priorities. As described in  Chapter 3, there are situations where the impacts  from sea level rise are significant and already  present or imminent that may warrant taking on  the bigger challenges in the near term even if all  the funding needed is not presently identified.  Prioritization enhances the impact of Focus Area- driven adaptation strategies by ensuring that  the community adds additional aspects to the  comprehension of coastal flooding in the greater  context and functioning of the community.", "334": "4.2. Create a Schedule of Activities, Actions,  and Actors Creating a Schedule of Activities, Actions, and Actors takes the sec- ond half of implementation into account  providing impetus to the  actions to be completed and the agency/department/staff responsi- ble for each action. This sub-component can serve to program differ- ent types of adaptation activities according to their prioritized need  (see Chapters 3.2 and 4.1.1) and, in pairing with funding opportunities,  generate a concise and easy-to-follow plan. To create a schedule that is flexible yet delegates responsibility, the  planning team should identify the appropriate responsible party who  has the ability to complete a task, activity, or strategy.25 The plan- ning team may then schedule their monitoring and evaluation (see  Chapter 4.3) to follow up with the responsible local staff member.  Scheduling transfers responsibility to the implementing entity to  set and maintain timelines while ensuring that a coordinating group  remains informed and responsive to the activity as it is carried out  and later evaluated. However, due to the multi-disciplinary approach  needed to undertake many adaptation measures, it is recommended  that support personnel be assigned to projects to assist the primary  with the additional skill sets, knowledge base, and contacts needed to  successfully implement a project. Scheduling activities and assigning staff may emphasize the util- ity of planning ahead as the various elements of the schedule come  online. By naming the person or group responsible for each activitys  implementation, more accurate timelines can be made which may  economize the implementation process. As discussed in Chapter 3.4,  integrating adaptation into existing plans, if the strategy involves incor- porating activities into a regulatory document, provides an opportu- nity to program capacity building measures. For this sub-component,  the planning team is encouraged to consider consultants outside of  local government staff. A diverse set of participants within the steering  committee could connect individuals or entities from a wide berth in  the private sector, non-profits, and universities.", "335": "4.3. Monitor and Evaluate In order to ensure that adaptation  strategies continue to serve their  intended purpose  to robustly  respond to the community priori- tized sea level rise vulnerabilities   it is recommended that an adapta- tion plan include a Monitoring and  Evaluation component. Monitoring  and Evaluation extends throughout  the horizon of the plans implemen- tation, which could extend for many  years. The ability to communicate  the guiding goals of the plan across iterations of implementing manag- ers is essential. This is done through a Monitoring and Evaluation plan  that uses consistent criteria, such as indicators that can be tracked  throughout the implementation horizon, and rated by different imple- menting managers. For this sub component, the planning team is encouraged to use indi- ces or performance indicators to easily determine if an adaptation  strategy is performing adequately. For example, point values could be  assigned based on various levels or percentages of project completion  to measure the progress towards completion, or project benchmarks  or major milestones could be established to track accomplishments  and project status. Monitoring of the adaptation strategies is a check-in to see that strate- gies are being carried out as anticipated and intended. This can include  review of successful actions identified and implemented, review of  barriers or obstacles to implementation for strategies that were iden- tified but not completed, need for revisions to activities based on  review, and reevaluation of proposed timelines based on new informa- tion on impacts and funding. Once the progress attained is evaluated,  activities can be revised where needed to make certain the adaptation  plan goals are being achieved. Revisions and updates of the strategies  can also consider potential changes in hazard vulnerability, local capa- bilities and resources, and risk reduction priorities. Lessons learned  during the implementation should be shared across the community  and even with other communities to expand the knowledge base of  what is working, what would work better with some modifications,  and the pitfalls to avoid. In addition to monitoring activities, it is important to revisit the data  and methodologies that go into the Vulnerability Assessment. Of these,  the sea level rise projection model may be one of the most important  aspects of an adaptation plan to monitor. Over an example horizon of  five years, global climate models and viewing tools may increase their  accuracy and level of representation. The planning team can respond to  this by incorporating model update results into new iterations of their  adaptation plan. For example, new projection model updates could  project a faster or slower rate of sea level rise, and therefore, the plan- ning horizon and timelines for implementation of adaptation activities  may be adjusted to reflect the updated or best available information. Monitoring and Evaluation  should be approached with  an Adaptive Management  mindset to constantly strive  to improve the approach as  lessons learned are obtained  and new data is available. This  sustained effort helps keep the  planning process viable over  many years and should help  build momentum to adapt to  the changing environment.Adaptation Planning Guidebook | 59 58 | Adaptation Planning Guidebook Post-disaster evaluation efforts  are a productive combination  with adaptation monitoring and  updates. Moreover, if a commu- nity experiences a disaster event,  more attention will shift toward  adaptation efforts, and higher inci- dences of buy-in for certain adap- tation activities may arise. Partic- ularly, larger-scale disaster events  could greatly accelerate the imple- mentation schedule. Therefore,  the schedule of activities can be  changed to reflect new timelines  for more robust measures.", "336": "4.5. Public Outreach Approach and  Opportunities for Community Participation Outreach can be one of the most important activities within a program  because it can lead to municipal action in the future. Increased stake- holder engagement throughout the adaptation planning process can  help to create buy-in amongst the public which can then in turn lead  to greater political support for adaptation actions in the community.  Holding public meetings, forums, or workshops that include business  groups, residents, and other community stakeholders can provide an  opportunity to educate participants and receive feedback based on  their understanding of local vulnerabilities to sea level rise and poten- tial responses. It can also be used as an opportunity to establish a con- nection between incremental improvements to citizen and property  safety and welfare and a more desirable future community. Participatory monitoring efforts can help the community observe  unanticipated coastal flooding impacts and effects of adaptation strat- egies. Stakeholder feedback can be used to gauge community satisfac- tion with adaptation strategies and their implementation and provide  a forum for addressing new concerns as they arise. These two partic- ipatory activities will continue after the initial planning effort is com- plete and may be integrated with other ongoing monitoring and evalu- ation mechanisms to ensure that continued attention is paid to them.  Communities should establish a long-term, simple feedback mecha- nism whereby individuals may express new concerns or developments  about the selected adaptation projects. In addition, some adaptation  projects (usually environmental) involve a degree of monitoring. Com- munity members may be willing to volunteer their time to observe if  the desired effects are occurring and even to provide maintenance and  upkeep labor.", "337": "Resilience has many definitions, but in the context of this guidebook,  it means the ability of a community to prepare for and adapt to the  effects of sea level rise, especially coastal flooding, erosion, and eco- system changes.

This  chapter, Chapter 1, introduced the guide, its purpose,  intended audience, methodology, and structure. The  remainder of the guide is organized as follows:  Chapter 2 Climate Change and the Coast provides a brief and general overview of the  value of our coasts and how they may be  affected by climate change to establish the  importance of adaptation planning.   Chapter 3 Planning Process describes the  steps to take to create a plan and bring it to  life.  Chapter 4 Vulnerability Assessment explains the elements involved in a  vulnerability assessment for the purposes of  guiding adaptation efforts.  Chapter 5 Adaptation Strategy discusses  how to establish goals and identify actions  that may be able to reduce the negative  impacts associated with climate change and  introduces a framework to help users choose  and prioritize actions that will aid them in  achieving their goals.  Chapter 6 Plan Implementation and  Maintenance suggests ways to implement  a plan; track, evaluate, and communicate its  progress; and update it to reflect completed  actions, changing circumstances, and new  science, data, tools, and techniques.

Appendix B Federal Laws and Executive  Orders Relevant to Climate Change on  the Coast lists some of the federal laws and  executive orders that support climate change  adaptation.  Appendix C Regional Climate Summaries  provides brief summaries of how climate  change may affect the different regions of the  United States.", "343": "The Value of Our Coasts Our coasts are critically important to our nation,  supporting a large percentage of its population as well  as its economy. In 2007, According to the National  Ocean Economics Program (NOEP), the coastal  zone was home to an estimated 127 million people,  supported 57 million jobs, and contributed $6.7 trillion  to the U.S. economy, accounting for 42 percent of  the U.S. population and 49 percent of its national  economic output (NOEP 2009a).  In its 2009 State of the U.S. Ocean and Coastal Economies  report, the NOEP provided a snapshot of the 6 A Planning Guide for State Coastal Managers ocean economy. The ocean economy consists  of economic activities that are tied to the ocean or  Great Lakes, or that are partially related to the ocean  or Great Lakes, and are located in a shore-adjacent  zip code. In 2004 (the most recent year for which  the information is available), the ocean economy  contributed $138 billion to the U.S. economy:  Tourism and recreation: $70 billion  Marine transportation: $28 billion  Offshore minerals: $20 billion  Ship and boat building: $11 billion  Living resources: $7 billion  Marine construction: $3 billion Measuring the ocean economy is complicated, and  data are limited. In order to make data compatible and  comparable across all six sectors, some sector data  were excluded in the NOEP study. Sector-specific  reports from other sources, which use different  definitions, methodologies, and parameters, can  provide greater detail. For example, NOAAs National  Marine Fisheries Service reported that the commercial  fishing industry generated over $103 billion in sales  and $44 billion in income in 2006. That same year,  recreational fishing contributed $82 million in sales  (largely in durable equipment) to the U.S. economy  and generated $38 billion in value-added impacts  (NOAA n.d. Fisheries). The coasts also provide a number of services that do  not have traditional market values but in total may  be even more valuable than those that do. The value  of coastal wetlands, for example, has been estimated  to be between $3 and 13 million per km2 (Knogge  et al. 2004). And, additional research suggests that  the storm protection services they provide are worth  $23.2 billion annually (Costanza et al. 2008). The total  nonmarket value for U.S. coastal and ocean resources  is at minimum tens of billions of dollars per year  and likely much more (NOEP 2009b). According to the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,  coastal ecosystemscoastal lands, areas where  fresh water and salt water mix, and nearshore  marine areasare among the most productive yet  highly threatened systems in the world. These  ecosystems produce disproportionately more  services relating to human well-being than most  other systems (Hassan et al. 2005). Some of the  nonmarket services provided by coastal ecosystems  (e.g., estuaries, marshes, coral reefs, mangroves,  lagoons, salt ponds, seagrass) include flood and  storm protection, erosion control, water quality  maintenance, biological productivity, fish and  wildlife habitat, recreational opportunities, and  aesthetic value", "344": "Impacts and Consequences of  Climate Change on the Coast Our nations coasts are particularly susceptible  to climate change. They are already subject to  an array of social and environmental stressors  that have resulted in habitat loss and conversion,  habitat degradation, and overexploitation. Key  stressors include coastal development, storms  and other natural processes (e.g., erosion  and subsidence), deforestation, pollution,  invasive species, unsustainable and destructive  fishing practices, recreational activities, energy  development, etc. Climate change, defined by  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC) as any change in climate over time,  whether due to natural variability or as result of  human activity, will exacerbate these stressors  (IPCC 2007a). Implications are expected to be far  reaching for coastal communities, economies, and  ecosystems (Karl et al. 2009).  Since 1900, the global average surface temperature  of the Earth has risen by about 1.5F (Karl et al.  2009). And, the 2000s decade (2000-09) was the  warmest on record, with 9 of its 10 years (2001- 09) ranking among the top 10 warmest years on  record (NOAA 2010a). Significantly, it was the  global warming that occurred over the last 50 years  that accounts for the majority of the increase,  which is largely attributable to human activities (i.e.,  greenhouse gas emissions). In the United States, the  average temperature has risen more than 2F over  the last 50 years (Karl et al. 2009). ", "345": "The IPCC has projected a likely rise in the average  global surface temperature of an additional 2 to 11.5F  by 2100 (relative to the 1980-99 time period) based on  an assumption of no changes in climate policy. In the  United States, the average temperature is projected to  increase by approximately 7 to 11F under a higher  emissions scenario and by approximately 4 to 6.5F  under a lower emissions scenario (Karl et al. 2009).  In addition to increases in air temperature, there is  evidence that other associated changes are taking place.  Some of these climate change phenomena, which are  discussed throughout this guide, include rising sea levels,  declining Great Lake levels, increasing storm intensity/ frequency (tropical and cold-season storms), changing  precipitation patterns, increasing water temperature, and  ocean acidification. The effects of these changes are  being observed across all sectors in the United States and  around the world (Karl et al. 2009).  Our understanding of the effects of climate change  on the United States is still evolving. According to the  U.S. Global Change Research Program, future changes  in some phenomena are more difficult to project than  others (e.g., changes in precipitation are more difficult to  project than changes in temperature) (Karl et al. 2009).  A lot remains uncertain and depends on the success of  our efforts to mitigate climate change. Nevertheless,  despite the uncertainties, current climate change  projections are considered reliable enough to warrant  and support adaptation planning (Karl et al. 2009).  ", "346": "Ultimately, rising sea levels mean land and ecosystem  loss. Some degree of economic loss is inevitable. In  1991, the Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA) estimated that a one-foot rise in sea level by  2100 would increase annual flood damage to insured  property by 36-58 percent and a three-foot rise would  increase annual damage by 102-200 percent. Recent  estimates indicate that a sea level rise of nearly 20  Storm surge on a Louisiana highway shows the potential effects of  rising sea levels.13 Adapting to Climate Change  inches by 2100 would cause $23-170 billion in  damage to U.S. coastal property (Ruth et al. 2007).  In addition, as land and ecosystems are inundated,  associated cultural resources may also be lost,  especially where populations, both human and  otherwise, are forced to relocate.", "347": "In recent decades, coastal storms have accounted  for the majority of U.S. annual disaster losses (Heinz  Center 1999; NOAA 2010a). Thus, in coastal areas,  where real estate values may be very high, the potential  economic impacts of natural disasters, which will be  exacerbated by climate change, could be significant.  The 2004 Atlantic hurricane season caused damage and  incurred associated costs estimated at more than $50  billion. One year later, Hurricane Katrina alone cost  approximately $134 billion, becoming the costliest U.S.  storm on record (NOAA 2010a).

While  this guide is written for coastal managers at the state  level and focuses largely on activities for which they  have responsibilities, your state may want to address  adaptation at a larger scale. In that case, you may be  the lead, or you may be one of many planning team  members.  The process described in this guide can be scaled  up to incorporate impacts, consequences, and  sectors not discussed here (e.g., those not under the  jurisdiction of the coastal management program)  or can be scaled down to focus on a single impact,  consequence, or region. Conducted on its own, a  coastal adaptation plan could easily be integrated  into larger planning efforts, which may or may not  yet have begun.  Consider whether a stand-alone adaptation plan  is really necessary. What other ongoing planning", "350": "efforts is your state engaged in? Some states are  including climate change adaptation planning along  with climate change mitigation planning or in their  hazard mitigation plans, which may give short shrift to  ecological systems and needs. Others are including it in  wildlife action plans, which, in turn, will likely exclude  impacts on the built environment. Other plans that  may relate to climate change adaptation include coastal  management, watershed management, emergency  operations, transportation, economic development, and  growth plans. These plans are also excellent resources  for the adaptation plans vulnerability assessment and  adaptation strategy.  Know what your state is thinking about climate  change adaptation planning, both short and long  term, and where your program best fits into the  process. Also, look into how adaptation planning  is being handled at the local level in your state and  consider how to incorporate existing efforts into your  plan and/or how your plan can be used to guide and  support local planning. A new state law or executive order authorizing the  climate change adaptation planning process would  help ensure it has adequate resources, support, and  legitimacy. This may require educating elected officials,", "351": "which should be done early in the planning process.  See the discussion beginning on page 23 about  educating, engaging, and involving stakeholders.", "352": "Human resourcesThis category includes  anyone who will help with plan development  and implementation. This is a planning team  effort, as is described in the next step, and  responsibilities should be distributed across  participants and other stakeholders. By  engaging multiple agencies, sectors, and levels  of government, the plan will become less of  a burden on any one entity and will benefit  from access to more information and points of  view, as well as financial and technical resources  and greater acceptance and buy-in to the idea  of climate change adaptation and the climate  change adaptation plan.  ", "353": "Technical resourcesClimate change  adaptation planning and implementation will  require a lot of technical data and know-how.  Much of the expertise can be secured when  building the planning team. You will need  people who understand and track the science  as well as people who can take the science and  state-specific data and help decipher what it  may mean for your coastal areas. This will likely  require information technology ranging from  basic geographic information systems (GIS) to  sophisticated modeling programs. Understand  the limitations of your states computing  capacity before acquiring the latter. If you do  not have access to the technical expertise or  the necessary computing capacity, you may  want to consider contracting with a university,  consulting firm, or other technical partner.  Finally, you will likely need to involve social  scientists and technical experts (e.g., engineers,  biologists, geologists) when you identify and  implement adaptation actions.", "354": "Financial resourcesYou will need financial  resources to support both human and technical  resources as well as general planning activities  (e.g., public meeting notices, meeting space,  office supplies, etc.). A number of federal  agencies provide grants for planning and  implementation activities, most of which, at  this point in time, indirectly support climate  change adaptation.

Coordination and collaboration with  these entities is vital to the success of the adaptation  plan. You may prefer to conduct your vulnerability  assessment before you build the planning team, but  having the team in place first means more resources,  and likely better information, are available for the  assessment.

Who you invite to participate on the planning  team, and who you choose to involve in more of a  supporting role, will depend on state-specific needs  and circumstances. Nevertheless, involvement of  a diverse set of stakeholders will be critical to the  process. More information about how to involve  stakeholders, including the general public, who may  not be directly involved as part of the planning team,  is presented in the next section. Most of the state  and federal partners on the planning team will likely  already be aware of the need to adapt to climate  change impacts. If not, be sure to educate them as  you would other stakeholders as discussed in the next  step. Planning is a partnership- and consensus-building  exercise that requires a variety of skills and expertise.  It will allow coordination and integration of activities  across agencies, organizations, and jurisdictions,  capitalizing on human, technical, and financial  resources and avoiding unnecessary redundancies.  It should be an inclusive process that allows  diverse concerns to be addressed, considered, and  incorporated. And, it will also require creativity and  compromise. Your climate change adaptation planning team will  be responsible for overseeing, coordinating, and  advocating climate change adaptation from planning  through implementation and beyond. Ideally,  members of the planning team will be engaged in  climate change issues or be willing to become so, be  able to provide needed input to the process, and have  the support of their employers.  It may be necessary to have a formal invitation  process, which could include asking agency and  department heads (or other figures of authority)  to designate appropriate representatives to serve  on the planning team. This can help ensure the  representative has some level of authority to act on  behalf of the organization. Such a request could  be sent as a letter explaining the need for the plan,  the planning process, and the role of planning team  members, which could include:  Participating in planning meetings  Providing input and information for the  vulnerability assessment  Participating in goal setting  Identifying adaptation actions for the plan  Reviewing and commenting on plan drafts  Assisting with outreach activities   Monitoring implementation of activities  specific to their organizations  Contributing to plan review and updating  activities  Working to mainstream climate change  adaptation into other agency activities Your climate change adaptation planning team will  cross levels of government and sectors. Inclusion of  a wide variety of partners will result in a coast better  prepared for the impacts of climate change. As you  structure the planning team, some of the questions for  consideration include:  What entities engage in activities that might impact or stress coastal systems and activities  managed by the coastal management program?

These phenomena are:  Rising Sea Levels  Declining Great Lake Levels  Increasing Storm Intensity/Frequency  Changing Precipitation Patterns  Increasing Air Temperature   Increasing Water Temperature  Ocean Acidification Because of the strong regional variations in most of  these phenomena, and based on the scope of the  plan, the planning team will need to decide which  phenomena to include in its vulnerability assessment.  There are a number of resources available to help with  this decision and to provide input into other steps of  this assessment. The U.S. Global Climate Research  Programs Global Climate Change Impacts in the United  States, which contains information about potential  impacts by region and is the authoritative source on  climate change science and impacts in the United States,  provides a good starting point.

As data are collected  about natural resources, the planning team may want  to consider attributes of these systems that provide  a sense of how vulnerable they may be to climate  change and, thus, which systems may need the most  assistance preparing for and responding to climate  change.

To model climate change in your state, consider  1) using the results of the scenarios generated for  2100 for the IPCCs Fourth Assessment Report7 and adjusting global projections to account for local  conditions (e.g., add local subsidence projections  to global sea level rise projections) and to estimate  shorter-term projections or 2) downscaling global  climate data.

Other important factors include the availability of  financial, technical, and human resources and the  states acceptable level of impacts. Goals should  be clearly written, attainable, and measurable  (qualitatively or quantitatively).  After reviewing the vulnerability assessment  findings, a good starting point for goal setting is  to review goals established in other state plans/ programs (e.g., those for coastal management,  hazard mitigation2, emergency operations,  environmental preservation, economic development,  resource management, transportation, etc.).  Adaptation plans from other governments, state and  local, are also useful resources. Some of these plans  can be accessed online at http://collaborate.csc .noaa.gov/climateadaptation/.", "395": "Step 3.2: Identify Actions Since many of the impacts and consequences of  climate change are not new, simply exacerbated or  accelerated, actions to reduce them already exist and  are being implemented outside the context of climate  change. This chapter illustrates how familiar actions  can also be used to support climate change adaptation. However, some of these actions are likely insufficient  for addressing the scale of the potential changes. It  will take a combination of existing, reconfigured, and  new actions to meet the challenges of climate change.  Importantly, the potential impacts of climate change on  the coast should be considered in all related planning,  law and policy making, and investment activities.", "396": "While reviewing state plans for possible goals,  also look at the actions and consider the following  questions in regard to actions along the coast as well  as elsewhere in the watershed:  Are there any actions that directly address  climate change impacts along the coast?   Are there any actions that indirectly address  climate change impacts along the coast?  Are there any actions that could or should  be modified to help meet the goals of the  adaptation plan?   Are there any actions that are in direct conflict  with the goals of the adaptation plan? To ensure the plan is inclusive of all actions that  may affect your coast and to avoid duplication, you  may want to consider incorporating ongoing and  already planned activities in your plan. Additionally,  there may be actions that could be modified to meet  multiple purposes with shared resources. If there are  actions that might hinder efforts to meet adaptation  goals, try to work with the entity responsible for that  action to reach a mutually beneficial solution. As  mentioned before, coordination and collaboration  among other state agencies and stakeholders is  critical, both to capitalize on each others efforts  and to avoid conflicts that could prove difficult and  expensive to overcome in the future. Think broadly and do not be afraid to think big. Do  not worry about resource or technology constraints,  these issues will be raised during the evaluation  process, which will help the planning team narrow  down the list and prioritize the agreed upon actions.  Hold on to the list of actions that do not make the  initial cut. In the future, some of these actions may be  more appropriate and/or feasible. Finally, be creative. Actions can be built to encompass one or more  measures (see examples in the table on page 51) and  should be crafted so they can be clearly understood  (e.g., does the action involve planning, promoting,  encouraging, mandating, constructing, etc.). While not  all of the measures included here can be implemented  at the state level, they are examples of activities states  can support and promote to local governments. A  lot of climate change adaptation will take place at the  local level, and financial and technical assistance from  higher levels of government, as well as mandates, in  some instances, will be vital to secure the necessary  level of local commitment. Not all actions included in this guide will be suitable  for every situation. One action may be appropriate  in one location but not in another. Suitability will  depend on circumstances specific to each state and its  ", "397": "coastal zone and may require additional research, study,  legal review, and legislative or regulatory change.  ", "398": "Planning, Law Making, and Regulating A number of measures can be used to alleviate many  of the impacts and consequences of climate change  and will be critical to successful climate change  adaptation efforts. Importantly, these measures include  planning, law making, and regulating. Adaptation  will require new, and modifications to existing, plans,  laws, and regulations. Going forward, all planning and  rulemaking activities should consider climate change  and future conditions so outcomes support, and do not  deter, adaptation efforts. Measures listed in the table on page 51 and discussed  further at the end of the chapter are more likely to be  acceptable and effective if they result from a traditional  planning process such as the one presented in this  guide. These measures can be incorporated into the  adaptation planning process or that of an existing plan  (e.g., comprehensive, hazard mitigation, watershed  management, capital improvement, etc.). Alternatively,  the planning team may decide a measure requires its  own plan (e.g., because of scope or complexity).  One type of plan encouraged by the Coastal Zone  Management Act is the Special Area Management  Plan (SAMP). SAMPs are broadly defined in the act  as plans which provide for increased specificity in  protecting significant natural resources, reasonable  coastal dependent economic growth, improved  protection of life and property in hazardous areas,  including those areas likely to be affected by land  subsidence, sea level rise, or fluctuating water levels  of the Great Lakes, and improved predictability in  governmental decision making (CZMA 1972). SAMPs  and other plans with similar intents are especially  appropriate in areas where authorities overlap and  coordination and cooperation is required to effectively  address the multitude of needs that have arisen along  the coasts. Many local governments, and some states, have  comprehensive plans to guide development. Some  states require local governments to have such plans;  others provide incentives that encourage them. In  ", "399": "either case, states typically specify the elements that  should be included in local comprehensive plans. For  the purposes of adaptation, a new adaptation element  could be specified, adaptation measures could be  incorporated into existing elements (e.g., land use,  transportation, environment, natural hazards, etc.),  as appropriate, or local adaptation plans could be  incorporated by reference. In addition, to address  climate change, the timeframe of comprehensive  plans may need to extend further into the future.  Incorporating adaptation into local comprehensive  plans in some way lends them the strength of internal  consistency, which is required by some states, to ensure  local actions are taken based upon and consistent with  the legally adopted comprehensive plan. Research on local comprehensive plans as vehicles  for reducing insured losses in natural disasters  suggests that comprehensive plans that include hazard  mitigation can reduce such losses: losses are lower  in states that require comprehensive plans and even  more so in those that require comprehensive plans  to address hazards. However, research also suggests  that in the absence of a state mandate to prepare a  comprehensive plan and address hazards, the planning  efforts of many local governments are inadequate  (Burby 2005). While mandates may result in plans, they may not  have the desired effect if they do not consider existing  barriers to effective planning and/or if the plans are  not effectively implemented.3 When issuing or revising  a state mandate, consider the role of the state in the  oversight process and how it can enforce and monitor  plan implementation as well as development and content  (while maintaining flexibility for local decision making). Since plans are typically not legally binding,  governments may pass laws and ordinances and issue  implementing regulations to best achieve the desired  outcomes identified through the planning process,  especially when it comes to land use. The Second  National Assessment on Natural and Related Technological  Hazards states No single approach to bringing  sustainable hazard mitigation into existence shows  more promise at this time than increased use of sound  and equitable land-use management (Mileti 1999).

In this task, the planning  team will decide which of the actions identified in  the previous step are actually suitable for the states  unique set of circumstances and then prioritize them  for implementation. Decisions will need to be made;  difficult tradeoffs may be required. Much of this  discussion is based on FEMAs Developing the Mitigation  Plan: Identifying Actions and Implementing Strategies (2003). One way to evaluate the proposed actions is to  use a method that considers the Social, Technical,  Administrative, Political, Legal, Economic, and  Environmental (STAPLEE) opportunities and  constraints of each action. The information the  planning team generates from this evaluation process  will help them weigh the pros and cons of each action  to determine which are best for the state. There are  no right or wrong answers. The criteria are defined as  follows:  SocialThe action should be socially  acceptable.   Will the proposed action  disproportionately affect (positively or  negatively) one segment of the population? Actions will need to be evaluated based on criteria established  by the planning team and, once selected, prioritized for  implementation.  Is the action compatible with present and  future community values?  TechnicalThe action should be technically  feasible, help to reduce losses in the long term,  and have minimal cumulative and secondary  impacts.   How effective is the action in avoiding or  reducing future losses?  Will it create more problems than it solves?  Does it solve the problem or only address a  symptom?  AdministrativeThe action should be  implementable by the state. Can the state meet  the staffing and funding needs of the action or  will it need outside assistance?   Does the state have the capacity (staff,  technical expertise, and funding) to  implement and maintain the action, or can  it be realistically obtained elsewhere?  PoliticalThe action should be politically  acceptable.   Is there political support to implement and  maintain this action?  Is there a champion willing to help see the  action to completion?  Is there enough public support to ensure  the success of the action?  LegalThe state must have the legal authority  to implement/enforce the action.   Does the state have the authority to  implement/enforce the action?  Are the proper laws and regulations in place  to implement/enforce the action?  Are there any potential legal consequences?  Will the state be liable for the action or lack  of action?  Is the action likely to be challenged by  stakeholders who may be negatively  affected?  EconomicThe action should be cost- effective and be likely to pass a benefit-cost  analysis.  Are there currently sources of funds that  can be used to implement the action?", "429": "What benefits (market and nonmarket)  will the action provide?  Does the cost seem reasonable for the  size of the problem and likely benefits?  What burden will be placed on the tax  base or local economy to implement this  action?  Does the action contribute to or detract  from other community economic  goals, such as capital improvements or  economic development?  What are the economic consequences of  not implementing the action?  EnvironmentalThe action should meet  statutory considerations and public desire  for sustainable and environmentally healthy  communities.  How will the action affect the  environment (land, water, protected  species)?  Will the action comply with state  and federal environmental laws and  regulations?  Is the action consistent with state  environmental goals? Once the planning team has decided on the  acceptable actions given review of the criteria above  (or a different set of criteria), it should prioritize the  actions for implementation.

In this guide, outreach  is the provision of information to all stakeholders  (anyone who will be affected by climate change  in your state), and education involves the formal  education system (typically kindergarten through  grade 12).  Purposes of outreach can include engaging  stakeholders in the planning effort, gaining support  for planning and action implementation, informing  the public about climate change and their role in  adaptation, communicating the benefits of natural  resources and ways to protect them, and changing  attitudes and behaviors. Outreach is not a one-time  activity. It should begin with the launching of the  adaptation planning effort and continue throughout  the process (as introduced in Chapter 3) and as  Using visuals to explain how coastal areas may be impacted  by climate change can build support for adaptation.  new information becomes available, milestones are  met, successes become evident, and whenever an  appropriate opportunity presents itself (e.g., when  the plan is released or when adaptation actions are  implemented that require support, adherence, or  assistance). There are numerous challenges to communicating  about climate change. The uncertainty of the  science and the presence of more immediate issues  are perhaps the biggest. While a few resources for  helping conduct outreach and craft and deliver  adaptation messages are noted at the end of the  chapter, the planning team should consider enlisting  communications specialists to help in this endeavor.  An outreach strategy can help guide climate change  adaptation communications and, similar to the  strategy for an adaptation plan, should identify goals  and actions to ensure stakeholders are being reached  in an effective manner. An outreach strategy involves  identifying the target population, conducting a  population profile (so the best way to communicate  with them is understood), crafting the message, and  then deciding how to disseminate it. There will likely  be multiple stakeholder groups/target populations  (e.g., planning team members and other participating  stakeholders, the general public, state and local elected  officials and other decision makers, developers,  resource managers, etc.) who may require tailored  messages and different delivery formats. ", "442": "As the strategy is drafted, the planning team should  consider what is already being done to reach the  target populations. Can climate change adaptation  be incorporated into existing government programs  for climate change mitigation, coastal management,  emergency management, public health, water  conservation, stormwater management, etc.? What  communications vehicles are planning team members  already using? Are there lessons learned that the  planning team can benefit from? As appropriate,  coordinate outreach efforts with federal activities,  including National Flood Safety Awareness Week,  Hurricane Preparedness Week, American Wetlands  Month, and others. Be prepared to take advantage of  windows of opportunity, which may come in the form  of extreme weather events (in your state or elsewhere);  the arrival of climate conditions that may affect your  state (e.g., annual storm seasons, El Nio, La Nia);  national media attention, etc. Effective communication has to achieve a match  between message content, framing, and the concerns  and values with which audiences resonate (Bostrom  and Lashof 2007). When communicating with the  public, consider geographic, socioeconomic, and  cultural differences. Who is most vulnerable? What  languages do they speak? What are their interests?  Surveys can help inform the planning team about  how stakeholders feel about climate change and  adaptation and what they value most and may help it  better understand how to engage them on the subject.  For instance, if some stakeholders have doubts about  climate change, or the term itself is too politically  charged, taking an approach that focuses on the impacts  and consequences, many of which they may have  already experienced or are familiar with, may be more  effective.4  A demonstration of the trends can illustrate  the need to take action.

In addition to the education provided via the outreach  program, the planning team may want to work with the  states department of education to create programs to  educate teachers about climate change and to develop  curricula for the classroom. The primary goals of  these efforts should be to equip students with basic  information about climate change and to empower  them to take action and to build awareness among their  family and friends.

By supporting pilot projects,  the state will be able to test out adaptation measures  in a limited number of communities before applying  them statewide. Financial assistance could also be  provided through incentives, where special funds are  only available where prerequisites established by the  state have been met.

Each program should address the  individual needs of the target population, which  could be elected officials; state and local planners,  natural resource managers, or building code officials;  developers; marine contractors; the general public; etc.  For example, a training program to educate elected  officials about their role in climate change adaptation  would look very different from a program designed to  teach marine contractors about living shorelines.  Many local governments already provide map  information services, where they respond to inquiries  regarding the location of a property in relation to  special flood hazard areas as well as its base flood  elevation. However, due to both financial and  technical constraints, this information may be limited  to information on a Digital Flood Insurance Rate  Map. Should the state expand mapping activities to  better capture the location of natural resources and  identify areas susceptible to other coastal hazards,  this information could be passed along (e.g., as GIS  overlays) to local governments to better inform their  map information service as well as their planning  efforts. In addition, this information could be used as  input to a coast-wide web mapping application that  would allow local governments and other stakeholders  to view the location of hazard-prone and natural areas.  In addition to providing data, maps, and models,  which will help lay the foundation for an adaptation  plan, the state can further support the planning  activities of local governments by providing  planning guidance, such as a local version of this  document customized for your state.

While growth  is often desirable and necessary, it must be managed in  a way that addresses the needs of the population and  also offers protection to natural resources and supports  the services they provide.  A robust planning program is essential to effectively  manage growth and development, and it is widely  recognized that land use planning is an effective way  to reduce risks associated with natural hazards (Burby  1998). While most growth will be managed locally,  there is still a role for the state to play, including  restricting growth where it affects state lands and  offering assistance and disincentives (e.g., not providing  funding for infrastructure or other services that will  encourage growth in inappropriate areas) to local  governments.

Growth and development management also includes  loss reduction and shoreline management measures.  These measures are discussed in more detail later in  this chapter.", "449": "Zoning Intended to create a healthy, safe, and orderly  community while balancing a diversity of interests,  ideally as envisioned by a comprehensive plan, zoning is  one of the most commonly used methods of regulating  land use. A number of the measures discussed in this  guide can be implemented through zoning.  Zoning can be used to regulate parcel use, density of  development, building dimensions, setbacks, impervious  surfaces, type of construction (e.g., easily movable),  shore protection structures, landscaping, etc. It can also  be used to regulate where development can and cannot  take place, making it an invaluable tool in efforts to  protect natural resources and environmentally sensitive  areas and guide development away from hazard-prone  areas. Permissible uses and standards vary by zoning  district. Types of districts include general use districts;  overlay districts, where provisions in addition to those  on the underlying districts apply; and special use  districts, in which all uses require permits.  Floodplain zoning is an example of a zoning application  that, if thoughtfully drafted, can provide multiple  benefits. In addition to protecting life and property,  benefits of floodplain zoning can include resource  conservation, open space preservation, public access,  and water-quality protection. Floodplain regulations that  just meet the minimum requirements of the National  Flood Insurance Program are more focused on how to  build safely in the floodplain and may not provide the  additional benefits", "450": "As the climate changes, adjustments will need to be  made. Zoning regulations will need to be adaptive.  Current regulations may need to be revised to  accommodate for new conditions. For example,  regulations that limit building height may need to be  altered in light of changing elevation requirements.  Your state may want to encourage local governments  to review the adequacy of their zoning, make changes  and additions as appropriate, and to consider climate  change in future zoning decisions. As the need for  new districts arises, model language can help ease the  process and advance state interests. Subdivision regulations, which are typically linked to  zoning regulations but often separate, are also useful  tools in limiting development in hazard-prone and  sensitive areas.

A building lost to one  storm is likely to be lost to another if built back  on its prestorm footprint and without significant  structural improvements. Despite the desire to  return to prestorm conditions, it is important  to build back right. Combining restrictions with  acquisition/demolition/relocation programs  provides safer options to property owners in the  wake of the loss of or damage to their homes or  businesses. Such restrictions will likely be more  acceptable if adopted prior to a disaster rather than  during recovery.  Restrictions could apply to repetitive losses or  severe repetitive losses as defined by FEMA, or  they could apply to any structure in a particular  area (e.g., the 100- or 500-year floodplain) that is  destroyed or substantially damaged. A prohibition  on redevelopment of structures destroyed or  substantially damaged by storms or chronic erosion  would serve multiple purposes. It would protect  life and property by removing them from harms  way and allow the natural and beneficial functions  of the floodplain to return. However, an outright  prohibition is often politically and practically  difficult to implement (though less so when public", "452": "health or access is at stake). Restrictions that attach  provisions to reconstruction, such as siting, design, and  construction requirements, are often more achievable. At a minimum, where rebuilding is allowed, general  permitting requirements for new construction  should be enforced, including for those structures  that were nonconforming prior to their loss.  In addition, rebuilding after a loss provides an  opportunity to include additional measures that will  better protect the building and the land on which it  resides", "453": "Conservation Easements A conservation easement is a legal agreement between  a landowner and a land trust or government agency  that can be used to restrict development in sensitive  and hazard-prone areas. Unlike acquisition and open  space preservation and conservation, which are also  useful tools for managing where development takes  place and are discussed in the Loss Reduction and  Coastal and Marine Ecosystem Management categories,  respectively, easements may not preclude other land  uses and allow property to remain in private ownership.  Landowners can sell or donate their easement.  Easements that are sold are also known as PDRs  (purchase of development rights). Landowners who  donate their easement may be eligible for federal  or state tax breaks. Easements typically apply in  perpetuity and are passed on from owner to owner.  Most are placed on individual properties, but they  may also be placed on subdivisions or coordinated  at a regional scale (e.g., to more effectively manage a  strip of shoreline or accommodate beach and wetland  migration).  Conservation easements can be placed on the entire  property or on select areas and can be written to  prohibit all types of development or to impose  restrictions and requirements in regard to size,  construction, etc.5  Easements can also be used to  ban or set standards for shore protection and restrict  ", "454": "activities that may impair natural processes.

", "455": "Compact Community Design Compact community design7  allows development  to occur while protecting natural resources. It is  a pattern of development that aims to use land  more efficiently by grouping a mixed-use of buildings  together, minimizing their collective footprint, and  leaving undeveloped land in its natural state.8  More  open space and fewer impervious surfaces means  reduced runoff and flooding. It also means reduced  investments in services and infrastructure design,  construction, and maintenance. Compact communities  are also known for their walkability, thus compact  community design also helps mitigate climate change. The high density development suggested by compact  community design can allow for more opportunities  to guide development away from sensitive and hazard- prone areas, but without proper planning, it can lead  to increased susceptibility to hazards. Any such design  must still consider the location of hazard-prone  areas as well as the location and carrying capacity of  evacuation routes. Compact community design is best  implemented in conjunction with zoning ordinances  that regulate development in hazard-prone areas and  strong building codes.", "456": "Along heavily developed coastlines, compact  community design may be difficult to implement  since little undeveloped open land will be available.  Nonetheless, there are times when opportunities  may present themselves, including when planning  economic redevelopment projects, when previous  uses on large tracts of land are no longer supported  (e.g., military facilities are closed down), and in the  aftermath of a disaster.", "457": "Acquisition, Demolition, and Relocation The most effective way to reduce losses is to acquire  hazard-prone properties, both land and structures,  demolish or relocate structures, and restrict all future  development on the land. Generally, acquisition is  the best and most cost-effective hazard mitigation  alternative because it permanently removes people  and their homes from harms way (FEMA 1998). In  addition, it can reduce the emotional and financial  costs associated with response and recovery from  future storms, reduce flooding by restoring natural  floodplain functions and increasing flood storage  area, and support environmental and public access/ recreational goals.  While acquisition serves multiple purposes, this  discussion focuses on the acquisition of land  and associated structures that are vulnerable to  natural hazards. The open space preservation and  conservation discussion later in the chapter examines  the acquisition of property primarily for natural  resource protection. Acquisition programs, also known as buyout  programs, typically acquire land and structures and", "458": "require structures to be demolished or relocated  and the land to be deeded as open space in  perpetuity and restored to its natural condition to  allow for more appropriate uses. Factors involved  in the decision to demolish or relocate may include  cost-effectiveness (some structures are easier and  cheaper to move than others), condition of the  structures, property owner interests, availability of  land for relocation, etc. Acquisition/demolition  projects are typically easier to implement than  acquisition/relocation projects. It is a good idea to plan for acquisition by identifying  and prioritizing properties and structures for  acquisition. Target properties may include:  Properties that have suffered multiple losses  (e.g., repetitive loss and severe repetitive loss  properties)  Properties with structures that are  substantially damaged or destroyed  Properties (with and without structures) that  are in an identified hazard-prone area (e.g.,  floodway, sea level rise inundation area, special  flood hazard area, erosion hazard area)  Hazard-prone properties for which retrofitting  (e.g., elevating) is not cost-effective  Properties in potential wetland migration  corridors", "459": "While buyout programs are typically voluntary, where  property owners are not required to sell, other tools  for acquiring structures and property in hazard-prone  areas include exactions and eminent domain. In all  cases, a concerted planning effort, involving potential  sellers where applicable, should be undertaken to help  avoid piecemeal acquisition that might result in coastal  blight or a checkerboard pattern of homes and vacant  lots that would still require public services and may  diminish property values. The actual acquisition may  take place in advance of a hazard event or in the wake  of one, when funding, and willingness to sell, may be  easier to come by and when eminent domain may come  into play. Typically, relocation involves acquiring land and  relocating structures out of harms way rather than  demolishing them. Some relocation projects, for  example, where the majority of the structures are  substantially damaged or destroyed, may involve  demolition along with active efforts to relocate people  into new homes in safer areas. Relocation may occur  at different scales. It may involve moving individual  structures or moving neighborhoods. In some cases, it  may even involve moving entire communities. A plan for relocation that identifies potential structures  for relocation as well as sites that can accommodate  them will ease the process in the context of postdisaster  recoveryor in advance of sea level rise inundation. In  instances where a homeowner of a habitable structure  (i.e., not substantially damaged or destroyed) is interested  in acquisition but not relocation, there may be other uses  for the building that would justify its relocation (e.g., for  local government usage, Habitat for Humanity, domestic  violence shelter, etc.).", "460": "Setbacks While setback and buffer regulations as described  in this guide are similar in effect, they differ in  purpose. The discussion here focuses on the use  of setbacks largely for the purpose of protecting  structures from hazards by keeping the structures  away from a propertys most vulnerable areas. As  such, they are closely tied to other regulations that  manage development in hazard-prone areas, such  as redevelopment, floodplain management, and  shore protection structure regulations. Subdivision  regulations can require lots to be deep enough  to accommodate initial setbacks as well as future  relocations. And, building codes can ensure  structures can be moved with relative ease. Setbacks may be regulated at the state or local level, or  both, and may be based on size or use. Typically, they  require structures to be sited at a distance measured  inland from a specific shoreline feature, such as a high  water mark, vegetation line, dune toe, or bluff crest.  This distance may be a fixed number of feet (e.g., 100  feet) or may be based on the long-term annual rate of  erosion (e.g., 30 times the long-term annual rate of  erosion). Fixed numbers may not be adequate in highly  erosive areas and may be too restrictive in others; and  setbacks based on long-term average annual rates of  erosion do not currently account for how erosion  rates will change as sea level rises. Neither allow for  catastrophic storms.", "461": "A 1990 report from the National Academies  recommended minimum development standards for  areas experiencing significant erosion based on local  rates of erosion (NRC 1990).

Building codes  that regulate design, construction, and landscaping of  new structures can improve the ability of structures  in hazard-prone areas to withstand hazard events  and can also reduce the effects of high temperatures.  They also indirectly protect neighboring structures  and natural resources. Building codes that consider  future conditions and the potential for climate change  and are regularly reviewed and updated based on new  information will provide even greater protection.  According to the Institute for Business and Home  Safety (IBHS 2005): A building code is the minimum acceptable standard used  to regulate the design, construction, and maintenance of  buildings for the purpose of protecting the health, safety,  and general welfare of the buildings users. The purpose of  building codes is to build safe buildings, thereby reducing  deaths, injuries and property damage. This preserves the  built environment, both residential and commercial, reduces  public and private disaster aid, and maintains employment  in businesses and institutions that otherwise might be  forced to close following a catastrophe. The level of protection provided by building codes  depends on the provisions of the codes as adopted  and enforced by state and local governments. State- imposed building codes can help ensure a minimum  level of protection. They may apply statewide, with  more stringent requirements in hazard-prone areas,  or they may apply only in areas susceptible to hazards  such as hurricanes. To provide even more protection  and address specific needs, states can allow local  governments to supplement the states minimum  requirements with additional provisions.  Many states and local building codes are based on  model codes founded on established scientific and  engineering principles. These model building codes  can be modified to better address specific needs and  hazards. The International Code Council maintains the  most up-to-date and widely adopted model building  codes, which incorporate multihazard disaster-resistant", "464": "construction standards. These codes include the  International Residential Code (single- and two- family structures) and the International Building  Code (commercial and multifamily structures). Two  consensus standards from the American Society  of Civil Engineers (ASCE) are referenced in the  International Codes and are also useful resources:  ASCE 24-05 Flood Resistant Design and Construction  and ASCE 7-05 Minimum Design Loads for Buildings  and Other Structures.  Post-disaster assessments have proven that, in most  cases, the use and enforcement of stricter building codes  produce buildings that are more resistant to disasters  (FEMA 2000). However, the enforcement of these codes  is critical to their success. Local building departments are  typically responsible for ensuring builders comply with the  codes so structures provide the base-level of protection  required by the state or local government. Enforcement  activities include permit approval, design and plan review,  and site visits. A successful building code program will  include regular continual training of enforcement agents  as well as education of the building community and  property owners.", "465": "Flood  In Special Flood Hazard Areas (100-year floodplain),  the minimum requirements of the National Flood  Insurance Program (NFIP) include requiring permits  for new and substantially improved development,  elevating the lowest floor of all buildings to or  above the Base Flood Elevation (BFE) (alternatively,  nonresidential buildings outside of the V-Zone can be  dry-floodproofed to the BFE); anchoring structures  to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement;  ", "466": "restricting development in the regulatory floodway;  using flood-resistant construction materials and  methods that minimize flood damage; and treating  substantially improved structures like new buildings  that must meet the minimum NFIP standards.

Buildings constructed in  the V-Zone, which is subject to coastal high hazard  flooding where waves during the base flood are at  least three feet, must also be elevated on pilings or  columns (i.e., fill is prohibited), and the bottom of  the lowest horizontal structural member must be  elevated to or above the BFE.

Increased structural wind-resistance can  be achieved by adhering to special design techniques,  using stronger, more wind-resistant materials and  connections, such as hurricane clips and the bracing  of gabled roofs; and protecting openings with impact- resistant materials or shutters", "469": "Retrofitting Although recent improvements in construction  practices and regulations have made new structures  less hazard-prone, many existing structures remain  vulnerable and will likely be more so as climate  changes. And, as these changes are realized and codes  evolve to keep up with them, even structures built to or  above current codes are likely to become threatened. Existing structures can be protected from hazards  through retrofitting.12 While retrofitting may not  bring a structure up to code (unless required during  a substantial improvement), it does help existing  structures better withstand hazard events and may  reduce insurance premiums. Retrofitting techniques  exist for a number of hazards, including floods and  high winds, and many of them are similar to those  required in the construction of new structures.  Examples include:  Elevating or floodproofing flood-prone  structures   Reinforcing and bracing roofs and garage doors  Anchoring homes to their foundations  Installing shutters on windows and other glass  openings  Removing impervious surfaces  Replacing exterior building components with  stronger, more hazard-resistant alternatives Since retrofitting is typically not required, homeowners  may not be aware of what they can do to protect  their homes and themselves. Regular improvement  and maintenance projects provide good opportunities  for homeowners to strengthen their homes as well  as improve the structure and increase its value.

Since infrastructure is  critical to the functioning of a healthy community, it  must be sited, designed, constructed, and maintained  so the provision of services continues uninterrupted.  Infrastructure protection entails fortification against  the impacts of climate change and, in some cases,  shoring up of capacity. While many of the ideas discussed under building  codes and retrofitting also apply to infrastructure, the  value of infrastructure, both socially and economically,  suggests the need for stricter requirements for new  infrastructure construction (e.g., plan for the 500-year  event, rather than the 100-year event) and a more  concerted effort to retrofit existing facilities and  systems. Roads, bridges, water and power utilities,  stormwater systems, and other infrastructure that  are already worn or overcapacity are likely to be  most vulnerable to climate change.13 Addressing and  correcting existing deficiencies needs to be a priority  and should be handled concurrently with adjustments  necessary to meet projected future conditions and  needs. Similarly, adaptation should be considered and  incorporated into regular maintenance and upgrade  activities. In general, designing for the future is less expensive  than retrofitting, rebuilding, or moving infrastructure.  When planning for new infrastructure, siting should  be the first consideration. Facilities and system  components should not be constructed in hazard- prone (current or projected) or valuable natural  resource areas, where possible, or in areas that would  encourage undesirable growth.

However,  they often damage or destroy other valuable coastal  resources (economic, ecological, recreational, and  aesthetic), require substantial expenditure (initial  design and construction and maintenance), and create  a false sense of security. They may also encourage  additional development. Shore protection structures  provide an immediate fix that may not be sustainable.  Nevertheless, it is understood that in some cases,  for the purposes of protecting existing (not future)  development, there may be no other acceptable or  practical options. Alternatives to shore protection  structures are discussed in the Shoreline Management  category that follows.  Shore protection structures are designed to reduce  flooding/inundation and erosion of land and protect  structures and infrastructure. Despite the name, the  intent is to protect the built environment and the land  it sits on rather than the shore itself. 13 Onsite sewage disposal systems will also be vulnerable as sea levels rise and their separation from groundwater becomes inadequate.  Learning from othersMassachusetts Considers  Sea Level Rise in Infrastructure Siting In the 1990s, the Massachusetts Water Resources  Agency designed and built Bostons Deer Island  wastewater treatment plant in consideration of sea  level rise. Specifically, the plant was built 1.9 feet  higher than required at the time to accommodate  the amount of sea level rise projected to occur over  the expected lifetime of the facility (~50 years). And,  in a nod to climate change mitigation, the plant  gets approximately one-quarter of its power needs  through on-site renewable energy sources.  www.mwra.com/03sewer/html/sewditp.htm78 A Planning Guide for State Coastal Managers Most shore protection structures are built parallel or  perpendicular to the shoreline:   Shore parallel (seawalls, revetments, bulkheads,  breakwaters, rip rap)These structures help  hold the land back from the sea and the sea  back from the land and/or dissipate wave  energy.   Shore perpendicular (groins, jetties)These  structures interrupt sediment transport and  trap sediment to build/rebuild beaches and/or  stabilize navigational channels and inlets.  While they may be successful at meeting the level of  protection they are designed for, all of these structures  disrupt the natural flow of sediment, which may result  in the loss of the natural shoreline, coastal habitat, and  the associated ecosystem services and amenities, either  directly in front of the structure or in adjacent areas.  With the exception of breakwaters, which are built  offshore, shore parallel structures also inhibit the ability  of wetlands to migrate inland as sea level rises and may  interfere with public access. In most cases, protection in  one area will lead to losses in another (or the demand for  more shore protection structures), both to the built and  the natural environment. Large flood control systems like dikes (levees) and  movable gates and barriers (e.g., Maeslantkering in  the Netherlands and the Thames River Barrier in the  United Kingdom) are also being considered as viable  defenses against sea level rise. These structures require  significant investment and come with their own set of  concerns and adverse impacts.  When there are no suitable alternatives, future  shore protection structures should be designe", "473": "Regulation and Removal of Shore Protection  Structures As previously discussed, the use of shore protection  structures is only supported as an action of last resort  to protect valuable real estate and infrastructure. They  often do more harm to the natural shoreline than  good. To protect the natural shoreline and the benefits  it provides, states can use regulations to limit shoreline  hardening as well as to promote alternative forms of  protection and to encourage development that reduces  the needs for shore protection structures.  Regulations can specify allowable uses, locations,  and structures, prohibit new structures, and/or  require the removal of existing structures given  specified circumstances (e.g., no longer maintained,  substantially damaged, need to return land to  natural functions, etc.). The size, design, and  placement of shoreline stabilization structures can  also be regulated to minimize environmental and  public access impacts. Regulations that severely  restrict the use of shore protection structures or  require their removal should also require disclosure  of such restrictions in real estate transactions.", "474": "Rolling Easements Rolling easements are shoreline easements designed to  promote the natural migration of shorelines. Typically,  rolling easements prohibit shore protection structures,  which interfere with natural shoreline processes and  movement, but allow other types of development  and activities. As the sea rises, the easement, which  is usually delineated by a physical characteristic such  as the line of vegetation, moves or rolls landward,  sediment transport and wetland migration occur as  nature intended, and public access to the shore is  preserved. Since rolling easements reflect changing  conditions, they are likely to be a more effective  response to the impacts of climate change than  traditional zoning, which is based on conditions at the  time of the rule making. Rolling easements, which may be donated, purchased,  or regulated, place no restrictions on development.  They allow landowners to build anywhere on their  property with the understanding that they will not be  able to hold back the sea by armoring their shoreline  or deny public access. Once the shoreline has eroded  to a point where a privately owned structure is on  public land, a threat to human health and safety,  and/or threatened by flooding and erosion, that  structure should be relocated. The possible need for  relocation may encourage the building of smaller,  more mobile structures that will likely cause less  environmental disruption.", "475": "Living Shorelines In low- to medium-energy coastal and estuarine  environments and tidally influenced creeks,  streams, and rivers, living shorelines can be  effective alternatives to shore protection structures  in efforts to restore, protect, and enhance the  natural shoreline and its environment.

The use of  vegetation and sand fences to build and stabilize  dunes is not a quick fix, will only be effective under  certain conditions, and may not be effective as a way  of encouraging the growth of new dunes where  dunes did not exist in the past.  A number of other measures discussed in this guide  can be used to manage and protect dunes, vegetation,  and associated habitat, including laws and regulations  (e.g., zoning, buffers, setbacks, etc.) that restrict  development and other harmful activities (e.g., sand  mining, foot and vehicular traffic). To continue to  allow for public access, dune walkovers or fenced  pedestrian paths could be considered in planning and  project design", "481": "Sediment Management  Sediment management is an important aspect of  shoreline management and supports some of the  other measures discussed in this category and the  next. It requires an understanding of sedimentation  processes in the management area, recognizes  the importance of sand and other sediments  in protecting, maintaining, and restoring the  shoreline and its associated waters and ecosystems,  and incorporates activities affecting the erosion,  transport, deposition, and removal of sediment.  These activities include dredging and placing  sediment, building shore protection structures and  other structures that trap or divert sediment, and  mining.", "482": "Sediment management is best accomplished through  a regional effort involving all levels of government  and other stakeholders (coastal as well as inland) who  share an interest in a sediment system (i.e., a system  within which sediment exchange occurs naturally).  Regional sediment management includes the entire  environment, from the watershed to the sea; accounts  for the effect of human activities on sediment  erosion as well as its transport in streams, lakes, bays,  and oceans; and protects and enhances the nations  natural resources while balancing national security and  economic needs (Corps n.d.).  Any regional sediment management effort should  include an emphasis on the beneficial use of dredged  material. A sediment management program that  recognizes sediment as a valuable resource and links  needs with appropriate opportunities will be the most  effective at reducing economic and environmental  losses associated with climate change. Beneficial  use of dredged material involves using sediment  dredged from waterways for a productive purpose,  such as beach nourishment, habitat restoration and  development, public access facilities, and shore  protection structures (e.g., levees and dikes), among  other things.", "483": "Ecological Buffer Zones Ecological buffer zones (buffers) are similar to setbacks  (and may be included within setbacks), but are typically  designed to protect the natural, rather than the built,  environment. By protecting natural resources, buffers  protect the natural and beneficial functions those  resources provide. Protective services include providing  habitat and connectivity; minimizing erosion and  flooding by stabilizing soil, providing flood storage, and  reducing flood velocities; and improving water quality  through filtration of harmful sediment, pollutants, and  nutrients. Specifically, buffers are land use regulations designed  to reduce the impacts of land uses (e.g., development)  on natural resources by providing a transition zone  between a resource and human activities. Typically,  buffers are maintained in their natural vegetative  state and activities such as vegetation removal, soil", "484": "disturbance, and construction are restricted or  prohibited. As climate changes, buffers will also be  able to support inland wetland migration as well as  carbon sequestration. The effectiveness of any buffer will depend on  several factors, including size, elevation, vegetation,  slope, soil, permitted activities, adjacent land uses,  stormwater flow, and erosion rate. In addition,  effectiveness will also be dependent on property  owner compliance and the monitoring and  enforcement of buffer regulations. If drafting  new or revised buffer regulations, consider these  characteristics as well as how buffers, and the natural  resources they protect, might be affected by climate  change in the next century.", "485": "Open Space Preservation and Conservation There are a number of benefits to preserving open  space. Open spaces can improve the environment  and a communitys quality of life and contribute to  economic well-being. Specifically, open spaces:  Protect and provide habitat  Reduce flooding and stormwater runoff  Support water quality maintenance  Promote groundwater recharge  Provide opportunities for recreation  Enhance natural and cultural resources  Sequester carbon  Allow for evaporative cooling Open space preservation and conservation can be  accomplished through the management of lands  dedicated as open space through a number of the  measures previously discussed, such as zoning,  redevelopment restrictions, acquisition, easements,  setbacks, and buffers. While there are costs associated  with the management of open space, the public  expenditures may be lower than if the land was  developed and the provision of full services was  required. Management costs could be defrayed by  transferring the title to a nonprofit conservation  organization.  Open space management plans can be developed  to guide the acquisition and use of open space in a  manner that fulfills multiple community objectives  ", "486": "(e.g., trails, athletic fields, campgrounds, community  gardens, wildlife refuges, environmental education  centers, etc.). Any such plan should consider the  impacts and consequences of climate change, sea  level rise and flooding in particular, to ensure that  investments are wisely made (land purchase as  well as use and amenity placement). Open space  management should also consider the key role of  open space in green infrastructure and wetland  migration programs (see more on these measures in  the pages that follow).", "487": "Ecosystem Protection and Maintenance Ecosystems are difficult and costly to repair and  replace. It is more desirable to maintain and protect  resilient systems. This largely involves reducing the  impacts of nonclimate stressors and may include:  Restricting activities (through regulations if  necessary)   Restoring natural processes, such as water  flow and sedimentation (e.g., by removing  shore protection structures or upstream  dams)   Encouraging stricter nutrient management  Reducing land-based pollution  Modifying harvest or use rates", "488": "Monitoring and responding to threats like  invasive species (see page 92), harmful algal  blooms, hypoxia, and coral bleaching  Conducting outreach and awareness  Acquiring sensitive lands and/or protective  buffers  Designating and/or connecting protected  area", "489": "Facilitating Wetland Migration Wetlands that are not able to naturally keep up with  increased rates of sea level rise through accretion of  sediment and organic matter may be able to migrate  landward, along with the functions and services  they provide, given the proper soil and hydrological  conditions and the lack of barriers. However, the  ability to migrate and ultimate sustainability will  depend on factors such as rate of change, topography,  and upland land uses. Although costly and complex,  if migration is constrained, wetland loss may be  compensated for through the creation of new  wetlands in suitable areas.  Steps that can be taken to facilitate wetland migration  include:  Prohibiting and removing shore protection  structures that would impede migration  Acquiring land suitable for migration through  easements or acquisition15  Requiring ecological buffer zones, setbacks,  and/or rolling easements  Adhering to the principles of compact  community design", "490": "Adopting policies that support these activities before  the suitable corridors are overly developed will likely  be more cost-effective and politically palatable than  once development has moved in. Wetland management  programs should include analysis of how climate change  may affect the coastal wetlands so strategic decisions  can be made about land acquisition and other protective  measures.", "491": "Managing for Ocean Acidification With the impacts and reversibility of ocean  acidification still uncertain, management responses are  still being developed. The mitigation of climate change  by reducing greenhouse gas emissions may be the best  response as adaptation may not be feasible. Currently,  recommendations to help reduce the impacts of ocean  acidification, in addition to mitigation, include:  Conserving and restoring natural landscapes  Reducing land-based sources of pollution and  nutrients that contribute to acidification  Reducing other nonclimate stressors to enhance  resilience  Promoting marine connectivity  Protecting high biodiversity ecosystems that are  likely to be less vulnerable to the impacts of  ocean acidification  Spreading the threat by replicating ecosystems  in different areas where pH may vary  Monitoring and sharing information with  researchers and other managers about observed  impacts", "492": "Ecosystem Restoration, Creation, and  Enhancement Unlike the previous measures in this category, many  of the activities designed to restore, create, or enhance  coastal and marine ecosystems entail manipulation of  the physical, chemical, or biological characteristics of a  site. While there is considerable scientific confidence in  support of activities that reduce nonclimate stressors,  the effectiveness of the measures discussed here in  helping systems adapt to climate change is not as  evident, and their consideration, while still essential,  requires a clear understanding of how a system  functions and how it might be affected by climate  change (CCSP 2008b).  These projects should be designed to withstand the  impacts of climate change, incorporating native  species that will be able to adapt to anticipated future  conditions. The focus should be on maintaining and  enhancing connectivity and preserving ecosystem  functionality and services rather than re-creating  a specific species composition. Representation  and replication can help increase the likelihood of  ecosystem or habitat survival.16 Ensuring resilient  native species and habitats are well-represented and  replicated decreases the possibility of catastrophic  events destroying systems. Specific activities for restoring, creating, or enhancing  an ecosystem will vary by ecosystem type as well  as by species.

CreationConverting a nonwetland (either dry  land or unvegetated water) to a wetland", "495": "EnhancementIncreasing one or  more of the functions performed by an  existing wetland beyond what currently or  previously existed in the wetland. There is  often an accompanying decrease in other  functions. Examples of activities associated with these  types of projects include planting and seeding,  which could include plant species adapted to  future climate conditions; waterflow modification;  sediment diversion and/or placement; filling canals;  recontouring topography; dredging and removal  of fill materials; prohibition and removal of shore  protection structures and other barriers that impede  natural processes; water quality improvements; and  invasive species control. Any project designed to restore, establish, or  enhance an ecosystem will require planning, long- term management, monitoring, and, possibly,  land acquisition. In general, of the three project types,  restoration is the most likely to be successful (Interagency  Workgroup on Wetland Restoration 2004). The outcomes  of projects that create new ecosystems or new ecosystem  services are more uncertain, especially when the additional  uncertainties of climate change are factored in. Wetland  creation is usually difficult and typically requires a lot more  planning and effort than restoration projects. Generally, it  is easier to create wetlands from open water than it is to  convert uplands. In either case, one type of ecosystem is  likely to be destroyed in order to establish the new one.  Tradeoffs will need to be made and understood.", "496": "Coral Restoring damaged coral reef ecosystems is an  important part of protecting and preserving ecosystem  health. Reef restoration can help prevent further  degradation and facilitate the natural recovery process.  Future work on developing restoration strategies may  ultimately make reefs more resilient to the impacts of  climate change. To date, most restoration efforts have  been focused on repairing damage caused by human  impacts, such as vessel groundings and anchoring,  and these efforts serve to restore natural function,  structure, and diversity among injured reefs. Managers  have conducted pilot projects on applying restoration  techniques that may be used to respond to climatic  event disturbances, such as coral bleaching, and disease  mortality events. Coral reef restoration largely entails stabilizing  and repairing the damaged framework, recreating  topography, and transplanting corals dislodged,  propagated in nurseries, and/or relocated from other  suitable sources (e.g., corals orphaned as a result of  coastal construction projects). Restoration of natural  processes may also include ecological approaches  Restored, created, and enhanced wetlands serve as storm buffers,  improve water quality, provide habitat to fish and wildlife, enhance  outdoor recreation opportunities, and more.  Learning from othersSouth Carolina Habitat Program Employs Community Volunteers The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources operates a community-based habitat restoration and monitoring  program that brings together volunteers and scientists to restore and monitor oyster habitat along the South Carolina  coast. The purpose of the South Carolina Oyster Restoration and Enhancement Program is to restore and enhance  oyster habitat by planting recycled oyster shells in the intertidal environment to form new, self-sustaining oyster reefs.  http://score.dnr.sc.gov/91 Adapting to Climate Change  such as reinstating herbivores, protecting herbivore  populations, enhancing recruitment, and reducing the  prevalence of disease. Restoration projects are difficult  and expensive and may take decades to demonstrate  their success. Thus, they require sound planning, long- term management, experimentation, and monitoring.", "497": "Artificial Reefs Artificial reefs are constructed of a wide variety  of man-made materials and placed underwater to  restore, create, or enhance ecosystems, typically as  a fisheries management tool. Properly constructed  and strategically sited artificial reefs can enhance fish  habitat, provide more access to quality fishing grounds,  benefit fishermen and the economies of shore  communities, increase total fish biomass within a given  area, and provide managers with another option for the  conservation and management of fishery resources  (NOAA 2007b). Artificial reefs may also serve as  breakwaters, protecting shorelines from erosion, and  provide recreational opportunities. NOAAs 2007 National Artificial Reef Plan (as Amended):  Guidelines for Siting, Construction, Development, and  Assessment of Artificial Reefs outlines the states role  in planning for artificial reef construction and  maintaining regulatory and quality control to ensure all  artificial reefs in state waters:17  Have biological justification relating to present  and future fishery management needs   Will have minimal negative effects on existing  fisheries and/or conflicts with other uses   Will have minimal negative effects on other  natural resources and their future use  Use materials that have long-term compatibility  with the aquatic environment18  Are monitored to determine whether reefs  meet permit terms and conditions and are  functioning as anticipated The use of artificial reefs is a complex issue that  requires planning, long-term monitoring, and  evaluation to ensure the anticipated benefits are  derived. There is still considerable debate on how  artificial reefs impact the natural aquatic community  into which they are introduced. Improperly planned,  constructed, or managed reefs may be ineffective, may  cause conflict among competing user groups at the  reef site, may increase the potential to overharvest  targeted species, or may damage natural habitats. In  such cases the benefits from the planned objectives  of these structures may be negated (NOAA 2007b).  In some instances, artificial reefs may not be allowed  in Special Aquatic Sites, which are areas possessing  special ecological characteristics of productivity,", "498": "habitat, wildlife protection, or other important and  easily disrupted ecological values (e.g., coral reefs,  sanctuaries and refuges, and vegetated shallows).", "499": "Aquatic Invasive Species Management Climate-driven changes are likely to combine with  other stressors to further increase the vulnerability  of natural systems to invasive species (Karl et al.  2009). Changes in climate may alter pathways;  influence establishment, spread, and distribution; and  affect the ability of native systems to repel invasion.  Impacts are likely to vary by region as well as species.  Some species, both desirable and invasive, may  thrive under new conditions; others may find them  unsuitable (EPA 2008). Despite the uncertainties,  aquatic invasive species management plays a critical  role in overall ecosystem management and should be  planned and implemented in a manner that is flexible  and considers and monitors for potential changes.  The Non-Indigenous Aquatic Nuisance Prevention  and Control Act of 1990, amended by the National  Invasive Species Act of 1996, calls for states to  develop aquatic invasive species management plans.  By incorporating climate change into these plans, they  could serve as the basis for modifying management  activities (prevention, control, eradication) to meet  changing conditions. In a 2008 report, the EPAs  National Center for Environmental Assessment  recommended the following initial steps:  Incorporate climate change considerations  into leadership and coordination
