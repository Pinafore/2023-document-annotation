(sec. 4003) this section modifies the method by which the fda assesses biosimilar biological product user fees and extends through fy2027 the fda's authority to assess and collect such fees. for example, this section establishes through fy2027 the annual base revenue and various adjustments to set the total amount that the fda must collect each fiscal year through the user fee program. for the purposes of setting such user fees, the fda must (1) increase the fees collected each fiscal year for strategic hiring and retention purposes, and (2) adjust the fees collected for each fiscal year by employing the capacity planning method the fda used to set such fees in fy2021. the fda must also increase the user fees assessed for a fiscal year if doing so is necessary to meet certain operating reserve thresholds for the fda's review of biosimilar biological product applications. if the operating reserve increases above certain thresholds, the fda must reduce the user fees accordingly. the section also makes other changes to the biosimilar user fees, including by (1) authorizing the fda to administratively remove from the biosimilar biological product development program a person who has failed to pay the required fee for two consecutive years, and (2) eliminating the biosimilar biological product fee. furthermore, for the purposes of assessing the biosimilar biological product program fee, if a biosimilar product manufacturer makes a request for a particular biosimilar product to be placed on a list for discontinued products, the fda shall consider the product discontinued on the date the request is received or when the product will be withdrawn from sale, whichever is later. if an approved biosimilar product was on the discontinued list on the first day of a fiscal year but is no longer on the list later in the fiscal year, the manufacturer of the product must pay the annual biosimilar biological product program fee for that fiscal year.
