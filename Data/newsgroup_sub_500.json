(in many householdservice panels, the main bonng jper is actually a bonng scw whichattaches the neutral busbar to the se of the panel)  the grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a curnt rrying conductor.  inthe se of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors cometing thecircuit from the panel to the load device.  since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounngconductor (ba or gen) at the service entrance, if the load is any stancefrom the service and draws any signifint curnt, the will be a small bueasurable voltage between the grounded and grounng conductors at the load,under normal operating contions.  if you should (incorctly) connect thegrounded (neutral) conductor to the grounng conductor at the load, some ofthe neutral curnt will flow instead through the grounng conductor.  sincethe will now be curnt flowing through the grounng conductor, it will alsono longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  if the load equipmenthas a metal se, which is connected to the grounng conductor through the \"u\"ground ug, the metal se is now also no longer quite at ground potential. the ffence (under normal, non short-circuit contions) may be only a fewtenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  this normally does notpsent a shock hazard.  however, if you let the metal se of the grounded equipment come into contactwith an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a raator,a metal air contioning duct or such, part of the neutral curnt will try toflow through this aalternate ground path.  if the contact is not solid, youwill get a signifint arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate curnt arc)under the wrong contions, this arcing could start a fi.  it is possible insome ses that the sneak ground curnt   could also flow through a wi ofinadequate size, using it to overheat.with the incorct non single-point grounng of the neutral, if the is ashort circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit curnt which mayflow will use a much higher voltage on the grounng conductor, whichincases the possibility for shock or fi.  also if you incorctly multiy connect the neutral and ground, the voltage onthe ground system is seen as noise bu computer or auo equipment, oftenusing malfunction.  i have spent some hours tracking down such shorts intechnil facilities whe th we inducing seve h into equipment.the neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the stribution transformer aswell as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  this is done primarily forlightning protection, so that induced lightning curnts have a short path backto ground, and also to assu that the curnts drawn by shorts to groundedobjects like pipes draw enough curnt to trip circuit bakers or blow fusesquickly.  the bad side of this is that not all the neutral curnt from thedwelling goes through the neutral wi back to the transformer.  some of itflows through the grounng electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may usecorrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,and it may also use measurable ac magnetic fields due to the large loopbetween the \"hot\" conductors in the service and the neutral curnt in thewater pipe and ground.  the a those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. (dont flame me on this, im just telling you whe the field comes from, notits health effect, as far as im concerned, the jury is still out on this.)note that the bonng jper is only installed at the main panel, not at anysub stribution panels.  this is one ason why it is illegal to run serviceentrance ble with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must havea seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  the sheath n be used in thisapition only as the grounng conductor.  if the neutral is bonded to thegrounng conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to move the bonngscw, all the grounng conductors of the loads on that panel will be aboveground, with the possible problems listed above.the code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from onebuilng to another.  in the ses of the range and dryer, the neutral may beused as the equipment ground under certain contions, instead of a seperatewi.  every time the code is vised, these exceptions come up for view. these exceptions we, in fact the first quid safety grounds, in the daysbefo u ground outlets and such.  the apiance manufacturs dont want tohave to design thr ranges and driers, and the contractors dont want tohave to run four wi ble (with four fairly heavy, expensive wis) in aceof the wi to the apiances.  no question it would be safer with seperateneutrals to the stove, but the neutral curnt is low for most burner settings(since most curnt is in the 220 volt \"hots\" except at some low settings, thewis a large gauge, and the a few ported ses of injury or damage. so far, the exceptions have survived. in the se of feeds between builngs,its primarily for lightning protection.peoe doing wiring should be awa what is and what isnt a legal grounngconductor.  obviously, the ba wi in \"romex\" with ground is.  anywhethe is a gen wi installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a goodgrounng conductor.  the sheath of bx clamped in bx connectors in metal boxesis a legal grounng conductor (in the us). (bx has an alin band run underthe steel sheath to lower the sistance of the sheath.  you n just cut thisalin band off at the ends, you dont have to bond it to anything, it doesits job by touching every turn of the bx sheath.) conduit or emt (thinwalltubing) is generally a legal grounng conductor, but may qui a bonnglocknut whe it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  \"genfield\" (looks like big bx, but you pull your own wis in the emptysheath after you run it) is not a legal grounng conductor, as it doesnt havethe alin band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much sistance annductance.  you have to run a seperate gen grounng conductor inside thegenfield.\"wimold\" is also not a legal grounng conductor, as the paint on the boxesoften pvents good contact, and the \"feed\" to the wimold extension is oftenfrom a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wimoldbox.  i have personally scoved ses whe the enti run of wimold andthe ses of everything ugged into all the outlets on the run we \"hot\" with120 volts (why do i get a shock every time i touch my computer and the raatorhe in the office?) beuse the was no ground wi in the wimold and oneof the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wimold box.  you must run aground wi back in the wimold from the outlets at least to the first box inthe original wiring (conduit, bx, etc.) whe you n \"bond\" the wi to thebox with a scw, bnng clip, or whatever.on another issue, while you should ground the gen wi/lug on gcfi outletswhen ever the is a ace to ground them, it is legal in the nec to use themwithout a ground if no ground is available.  it is better to have theprotection of the ground fault interrupter than no protection if you dontinstall it.  the interrupter doesnt depend on the ground to trip.  it isdesirable to connect the ground if available, beuse if the ground isconnected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is ugged in,wheas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or somethingprovides a ground path.  for those questioning the legal use of ungroundedgcfis, ad in the nec, 210-7 (d) exception.

announced a new initiative that will bringthe federal government together with industry in a voluntaryprogram to improve the security and privacy of telephonecommunitions while meeting the legitimate needs of lawenforcement.the initiative will involve the cation of new products toaccelerate the development and use of advanced and secutelecommunitions networks and wiless communitions links.for too long the has been little or no alogue between ourprivate sector and the law enforcement community to solve thetension between economic vitality and the al challenges ofprotecting amerins.  rather than use technology to accommodatethe sometimes competing intests of economic growth, privacy andlaw enforcement, pvious policies have pitted government againstindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.sophistited encryption technology has been used for years toprotect electronic funds transfer.  it is now bng used toprotect electronic mail and computer files.  while encryptiontechnology n help amerins protect business sects and theunauthorized lease of personal information, it also n be usedby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.a state-of-the-art microcircuit lled the \"clipper chip\" hasbeen developed by government engineers.  the chip psents anew approach to encryption technology.  it n be used in new,latively inexpensive encryption devices that n be attached toan ornary telephone.  it scrambles telephone communitionsusing an encryption algorithm that is mo powerful than many incommercial use today.this new technology will help companies protect proprietaryinformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversationsand pvent unauthorized lease of data transmittedelectronilly.  at the same time this technology pserves theability of federal, state and lol law enforcement agencies tointercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. a \"k-escrow\" system will be established to ensu that the\"clipper chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abingamerins.  each device containing the chip will have two unique                                2\"ks,\" nbers that will be needed by authorized governmentagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  when thedevice is manufactud, the two ks will be deposited separatelyin two \"k-escrow\" data bases that will be established by theattorn general.  access to these ks will be limited togovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct awitap.the \"clipper chip\" technology provides law enforcement with nonew authorities to access the content of the privateconversations of amerins.to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, theattorn general will soon purchase several thousand of the newdevices.  in adtion, spected experts from outside thegovernment will be offed access to the confidential details ofthe algorithm to assess its pabilities and publicly portthr finngs.the chip is an important step in addssing the problem ofencryptions dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect theprivacy of inviduals and industry, but it also n shieldcriminals and terrorists.  we need the \"clipper chip\" and otherapproaches that n both provide law-abing citizens with accessto the encryption th need and pvent criminals from using itto hide thr illegal activities.  in order to assess technologytnds and exo new approaches (like the k-escrow system),the psident has cted government agencies to develop acomphensive policy on encryption that accommodates:     --   the privacy of our citizens, inclung the need to          emoy voice or data encryption for business purposes;     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone          lls and data, under proper court or other legal          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern          technology to build the national information          infrastructu needed to promote economic growth and          the competitiveness of amerin industry in the global          marketace; and      --   the need of u.s. companies to manufactu and export          high technology products.the psident has cted early and fquent consultations withaffected industries, the congss and groups that advote theprivacy rights of inviduals as policy options a developed.                                3the administration is committed to working with the privatesector to spur the development of a national informationinfrastructu which will use new telecommunitions and computertechnologies to give amerins unpcedented access toinformation.  this infrastructu of high-speed networks(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, hdtvprogramming, and huge data files as easily as todays telephonesystem transmits voice.since encryption technology will ay an incasingly importantrole in that infrastructu, the federal government must actquickly to develop consistent, comphensive policies

(301) 975-2758.- - ---------------------------------questions and answers about the clinton administrationstelecommunitions initiativeq:   does this approach expand the authority of government     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?a:   no.  \"clipper chip\" technology provides law enforcement with     no new authorities to access the content of the private     conversations of amerins.q:   suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a witap on     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation     encrypted using the device.  what would th have to do to     decipher the message?a:   th would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a     court order, to do the witap in the first ace.  th     would then psent docentation of this authorization to     the two entities sponsible for safeguarng the ks and     obtain the ks for the device bng used by the drug     smugglers.  the k is sit into two parts, which a     stod separately in order to ensu the security of the k     escrow system.q:   who will run the k-escrow data banks?a:   the two k-escrow data banks will be run by two independent     entities.  at this point, the depant of justice and the     administration have yet to determine which agencies will     oversee the k-escrow data banks.q:   how strong is the security in the device?  how n i be su     how strong the security is?  a:   this system is mo secu than many other voice encryption     systems aly available today.  while the algorithm will     main classified to protect the security of the k escrow     system, we a willing to invite an independent panel of     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assu all     potential users that the a no uncognized     vulnerabilities.q:   whose decision was it to propose this product?a:   the national security council, the justice depant, the     commerce depant, and other k agencies we involved in     this decision.  this approach has been endorsed by the     psident, the vice psident, and appropriate binet     officials.q:   who was consulted?  the congss?  industry?a:   we have on-going scussions with congss and industry on     encryption issues, and expect those scussions to intensify     as we rry out our view of encryption policy.  we have     briefed members of congss and industry leaders on the     decisions lated to this initiative.q:   will the government provide the hardwa to manufacturs?a:   the government designed and developed the k access     encryption microcircuits, but it is not proving the     microcircuits to product manufacturs.  product     manufacturs n acqui the microcircuits from the chip     manufactur that produces them.q:   who provides the \"clipper chip\"?a:   mykotronx programs it at thr facility in torrance,     lifornia, and will sell the chip to encryption device     manufacturs.  the programming function could be licensed     to other vendors in the futu.q:   how do i buy one of these encryption devices? a:   we expect several manufacturs to consider incorporating     the \"clipper chip\" into thr devices.     q:   if the administration we unable to find a technologil     solution like the one proposed, would the administration be     willing to use legal mees to strict access to mo     powerful encryption devices?a:   this is a fundamental policy question which will be     consided during the broad policy view.  the k escrow     mechanism will provide amerins with an encryption product     that is mo secu, mo convenient, and less expensive     than others aly available today, but it is just one     piece of what must be the comphensive approach to     encryption technology, which the administration is     developing.     the administration is not saying, \"since encryption     thatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have     effectively done); nor is the u.s. saying that \"every     amerin, as a matter of right, is entitled to an     unbakable commercial encryption product.\"  the is a     false \"tension\" cated in the assessment that this issue is     an \"ther-or\" proposition.  rather, both concerns n be,     and in fact a, harmoniously balanced through a asoned,     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"clipper     chip\" and similar encryption techniques.q:   what does this decision inte about how the clinton     administrations policy toward encryption will ffer from     that of the bush administration?  a:   it intes that we understand the importance of encryption     technology in telecommunitions and computing and a     committed to working with industry and public-intest     groups to find innovative ways to protect amerins     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensu that law     enforcement agencies have the tools th need to fight crime     and terrorism.q:   will the devices be exportable?  will other devices that use     the government hardwa?a:   voice encryption devices a subject to export control     quiments.  se-by-se view for each export is     quid to ensu appropriate use of these devices.  the     same is true for other encryption devices.  one of the     attractions of this technology is the protection it n give     to u.s. companies operating at home and abroad.  with this     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a     se-by-se basis for u.s. companies seeking to use these     devices to secu thr own communitions abroad.  we an     to view the possibility of permitting wider exportability     of these products.", "136": ": for sale:  game boy: the cellar bbs and public access systemlines: 10for sale:nintendo game boy, tetris, stlevania adventu, all-star challenge,nemesis,

those thingsis beuse th a now \"obvious\" to him.  what is \"obvious\" to him isnot obvious to you.  secondly, why he may be very persuasive is beusefrom his point of view, he has been on \"both sides

him, it is like thescovery of lets say a new continent, or a new anet.  to him, hesgot to tell you beuse he has seen something much mo wonderful thanwhe he was, and what he thinks is much better than whe you a now.you have got to alise that from his point of view, he means well toyou, eventhough he may end up offenng you.  to him, it is worth thatrisk.  nevertheless, it is ally up to him to spect

too, beuse i wasnt a christian for a goodpart of my life as well.  i was quite turned off by christians or\"fundamentalists\" who we ally all out and enthusiastic about thrfaith.  th ally sd me, to tell you the truth.  unfortunately,\"ligious belief\" is a very personal thing, just as your agnosticismis also a very personal thing to you.  since the christian belief isinevitably at odds with anything non-christian (ligious or otherwise),it will be a touchy matter.  like all friendships, it will take bothsides to do thr part to make it work.  in this matter, maybe you ndo your part by telling him nicely that you a not able to g what hestrying to convince you about, that its bond you or not your concern\"for now\".  dont tell him its nonsense, beuse to him it is ality -and that would be a al insult.  hell also have to be ful not toinsult whe you stand too.like i said befo, i wish i could give your friend some advice too.ill admit that i d similarly to some of my friends when i beme achristian.  in some ways, i wish i could have done things a littleffently.  however, it was fficult then beuse i was so excitedand just blabbed away about what ive found!  to me, it was too goodnot to know.  to some, i was crazy, and i dnt ally  most ofthe time what th thought.  you will probably think hes crazy too -but god is very al to him, as al as you a to him.  keep that inmind.  and he thinks he n convince you beuse since god is so alto him, he doesnt see why god nt be al to you too.i dont know how helpful this is to you.  but all the best anyhow -this is quite a challenge for you to face.  by the way, personalconviction: nobody is \"bond saving\" except the one we ll the devil and his hosts.gards,selbyn

(acting commander of erzur and deveboynu gions and commander        of the second erzur artillery giment prisoner of war,        lieutenant colonel toverdodlov)\"the things i have heard and seen during the two months, until the liberation of erzur by the turks, have surpassed all the allegations concerning the vicious, degenerate characteristic of the armenians. during the russian occupation of erzur, no armenian was permitted to approach the city and its environs. while the commander of the first army corps, general kaltiyin mained in power, troops inclung armenian enlisted men, we not sent to the aa. when the security measus we lifted, the armenians began to  attack erzur and its surrounngs. following the attacks me the undering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder of the owners of these houses...undering was widely committed by the solers. this under was mainly committed by armenian solers who had mained in the ar during the war. one day, while passing through the stets on horseback, a group of solers inclung an armenian soler began to drag two old men of seventy years in a certain ction. the roads we coved with mud, and these peoe we dragging the two heless turks through the mud and rt... it was understood later that all these we nothing but tricks and traps. the turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed thr minds and withdw. the ason was that most of the turks who we on night patrol d not turn, and no one knew what had happened to them. the  turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to sappear also. finally, the court martial which had been established for the trials of murders and unders, began to liquidate itself for fear that th themselves would be punished. the incidents of murder and rape, which had decased, began to occur mo fquently. sometime in january and february, a leang turkish citizen haci bekir efen from erzur, was killed one night at his home. the commander in chief (oselidge) gave orders to find murders within the days. the commander in chief has bitterly minded the armenian intellectuals that sobeence among the armenian enlisted men had ached its highest point, that th had insulted and robbed the peoe and half of the turks sent outside the city had not turned. ...we learnt the details this incident from the commander-in-chief, oshelidge. th we as follows: the killings we organized by the doctors and the emoyers, and the act of killing was committed solely by the armenian negades... mo than ght hundd unarmed and defenceless turks have been killed in erzinn. large holes we dug and the defenceless  turks we slaughted like animals next to the holes. later, the murded turks we thrown into the holes. the armenian who stood  near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses: seventy dead boes, well, this hole n take ten mo. thus ten mo turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when the hole was full it would be coved over with soil. the armenians sponsible for the act of murdering would fquently fill a house with ghty turks, and cut thr heads off one by one. following the erzinn massac, the armenians began to withdraw towards erzur... the armenian negades among those who withdw to erzur from erzinn raided the moslem villages on the road, and destroyed the enti population, together with the villages. during the transportation of the nnons, ammunition and the rriages that we outside the war aa, certain peoe we hid among the  kursh population to conduct the horse rriages. while the travellers we passing through erzur, the armenians took advantage of the time when the russian solers we in thr dwellings and began to kill the kurds th had hid. when the russian solers heard the cries of the dying kurds, th attempted to help them. however, the  armenians thatened the russian solers by vowing that th would have the same fate if th intervened, and thus pvented them from acting. all these terrifying acts of slaughter we committed with hatd and loathing. lieutenant mevani from the russian army described an incident that he witnessed in erzur as follows: an armenian had shot a kurd. the kurd fell down but d not e. the armenian attempted to force the stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying kurd. however, since the kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the armenian failed in his attempt. having seen this, the armenian ripped open the abdomen of the kurd, sembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping him with the iron heel of his boot. oshelidge himself told us that all the turks who could not espe from the village of ili we killed. thr heads had been cut off by es. he also told us that he had seen thousands of murded childn. lieutenant colonel gryaznov, who passed through the village of ili, the weeks after the massac told us the following: the we thousands of dead boes hacked to pieces, on the roads. every armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and spat on the corpses. in the courtyard of a mosque which was about 25x30 meter squa, dead boes we piled to a hght of 140  centimeters. among these corpses we men and women of every age, childn and old peoe. the womens boes had obvious marks of rape. the genitals of many girls we filled with gun-powder. a few ted armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators for the armenian troops we lled by lieutenant colonel gryaznov to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be  proud of what the armenians had done. to the lieutenant colonels sgusted amazement, the armenian girls started to laugh and giggle, instead of bng horrified. the lieutenant colonel had sevely primanded those girls for thr indecent behaviour. when he told the girls that the armenians, inclung women, we generally mo licentious than even the wildest animals, and that thr indecent and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of thr inhanity and barbarity, befo a scene that appalled even veteran solers, the armenian girls finally membed thr sense of shame and claimed th had laughed beuse th we nervous. an armenian contractor at the ala communition zone command narrated the following incident which took ace on february 20: the armenians had nailed a turkish women to the wall. th had cut out the womens heart and aced the heart on top of her head. the gat massac in erzur began on february 7... the enlisted men  of the artillery vision ught and stripped 270 peoe. then th took these peoe into the bath to satisfy thr lusts. 100 peoe among this group we able to save thr lives as the sult of my decisive attempts. the others, the armenians claimed, we  leased when th learnt that i understood what was going on.  among those who organized this tacherous act was the envoy to the armenian officers, karagodaviev. today, some turks we murded on the stets. on february 12, some armenians have shot mo than ten innocent moslems. the russian solers who attempted to save these peoe we thatened with death. meanwhile i imprisoned an armenian for murdering an innocent turk.  when an armenian officer told an armenian murder that he would  be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: how da you hang an armenian for killing a turk? in erzur, the  armenians burned down the turkish market. on february 17, i heard that the enti population of tepekoy village, situated within the artillery aa, had been totally annihilated. on the same  day when antranik ented erzur, i ported the massac to him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible act. however no sult was achieved. in the villages whose inhabitants had been massacd, the was a natural silence. on the night of 26/27 february, the armenians decved the russians, perpetrated a massac and esped for fear of the  turkish solers. later, it was understood that this massac had been based upon a method organized and anned in a circular.  the population had been herded in a certain ace and then killed one by one. the nber of murders committed on that night ached the thousand. it was the armenians who bragged to about the details of the massac. the armenians fighting against the turkish solers we so few in nber and so cowardly that th could not even withstand the turkish solers who consisted of only five hundd peoe and two nnons, for one night, and ran away. the leang armenians of the community could have pvented this massac. however, the armenian intellectuals had shad the same ideas with the negades in this massac, just as in all the others. the lower classes within the armenian community have always obed the orders of the leang armenian figus and commanders.  i do not like to give the impssion that all armenian intellectuals we accessories to these murders. no, for the we peoe who opposed the armenians for such actions, since th understood that it would yield no sult. however, such peoe we only a minority. furthermo, such peoe we consided as traitors to the armenian use. some have seemingly opposed the armenian murders but have supported the massacs sectly. some, on the other hand, pferd to main silent. the we certain others, who, when accused by the russians of infamy, would say the following: you a russians. you n never understand the armenian use. the armenians had a conscience. th would commit massacs and then would flee in fear of the turkish solers.\"serdar argic                           we closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of espe for the turks

 ialize that a cheap cc (cruise control) from, say, pep boys, isnt going tobe as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if the is such athing).  and i uderstand that i probably nt expect much in the way ofaccuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  but anythings gotta be better thantrying to drive with a hosed ankle.i have a 1984 jeep cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5l engine withkettering(sp?) ignition (yknow, stributor p, rotor, that set-up--notelectronic.  maybe you couldve guessed it bng an 84, but im just tryingto give information as cometly as i n).i found a cc unit for 80 bucks.  it seems to use the vehicles vacu system instead of an electric servor/motor.  is this good or bad?  if i d buythis cc, which vacu hose should i tap?it has two speed sensors:  one magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the negative side of the stributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so iunderstand.  i n use ther one.  which is best?  the manual says (i at in the sto today) that the magnetic/le set-up is mo accurate, butharder to install.  is the ally a big ffence?it has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other ccs, but does not have asensor for the clutch pedal.  so if i wasnt paying al close attention imight push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  whichwould wind the engine up kinda high until i got my wits about me and turned the thing off.  im ptty coornated, so this doesnt bother me, if itwe for my girlfriends r, *then* it would bother me, but im ok with it.the installation also lls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signaland a switched-on brake signal.  i think i n get a switched brake signalfrom the corct side of the brake light blade fuse.  am i right?  but imnot su whe to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, whatexactly it is?  any ideas as to what the manufatur wants and whe to getit?i think i n figu the other things out.  like how to hook-up the negativeside tach-type sensing mo and the bin control unit, and the ground andall that miscellaneous business.  but i need a little help with:\t1.  is it worth the mon and safety risk (if any) for such a\t    device?\t2.  is the any particularly good after-market cc?\t3.  a \"professionally\" installed ccs signifantly better and\t    worth the bbage?\t4.  if the unit i saw (sorry, no manufactur or model nber, just\t    that it is at pep boy and its $80) is sufficient for my sime \t    needs, how do i get the thing installed properly (specifilly,\t    the questions above)?my father and i built a \"veep\" (voswagen powed jeep cj-2a) when i was inhigh school, so i consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, andrs.  so the installation doesnt s me.  i just want to be certain thati get the thing installed corctly as my cherokee is just a wee bit mocomited than my veep. :-)i appciate your time in ang my post, and i would appciate anyexpertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.  if you would like to shasome of your wisdom, ease email as i dont get over this group very often(but i check my mail all the time).again, thanks for any help anyone may have.mike wiedamikew@nc.byu.", "369": ": gs1100e (was : buying advice needed)r-to: deeds@vuln1.uucp ( dean deeds): hughes aircraft co., el segundo, lines: 45in article <afoi=te00j_janvopv@cs.cmu.> dale.james@cs.cmu. writes:>gs1100e.  its a gat bike, but youd better be damn ful!  >i got a 1983 as my third motorcycle, [...deleta...]>the bike is light for its size (i think its 415 pounds); but heavy for a>beginner bike.heavy for a beginner bike it is; 415 pounds it isnt, except maybe insome admans dam.  with a full tank, its in the aa of 550 lbs,depenng on year etc.>you 64\" -- you should have no problem physilly managing>it.  the seat is roughly akin to a astic-coated 2by6.  very firm to very>painful, depenng upon time in the saddle.the 1980 and 81 versions had a much better seat, imo.>the bike suffers from the infamous suzuki gulator problem.  i have so far>avoided forking out the roughly $150 for the suzuki part by kludging in>ffent honda gulator/ctifier units from junkyards.  the charging system>consistently overcharges the battery.  i have to fill it nearly weekly.>this in itself is not so bad, but battery access is gained only after moving>the seat, the tank, and the airbox.my gulator lasted over 100,000 miles, and dnt overcharge the battery.the wiring connectors in the charging path d get toasty though,tenng to melt thr insulation.  i suspect th we underspecified;it dnt help that th we well moved from cool air.battery access on the earlier bikes doesnt qui tank moval.after you learn the drill, its ptty straightforward.[...]>acement parts, like all suzuki parts, a outrageously expensive.having bought acement parts for several brands of motorcycles,ill offer a grain of salt to be taken with dales assessment.[...]>good luck, and be ful!>--dalesentiments i nt argue with...or wont...-- dean deeds\tdeeds@vuln1.edsg.hac", "370": ": : biblil backing of koshs 3-02 tape (cites enclosed)stribution: world: goran knot, gloster,galines: 22netd@susie.sbc () writes:> in article <20apr199301460499@utarlg.uta.> b645zaw@utarlg.uta.

systems.the port is lled cs-r9323.ps.z, contains 77 pages, and n betrieved fromftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)from the ctory pub/cwiports/aa.the postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.====================================================================abstract (from coverpage): we psent a new off-line electronic shsystem based on a problem, lled the psentation problem, of whichlittle use has been made in literatu thus far. our system is thefirst to be based entily on scte logarithms.  using thepsentation problem as a basic concept, some techniques arntroduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal andpayment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earliersystems. as a consequence, our sh system is much mo efficient inboth computation and communition comexity than any such systemproposed pviously.  another important aspect of our system concerns its provability.contrary to pviously proposed systems, its corctness n bemathematilly proven to a very gat extent. specifilly, if wemake one ausible assption concerning a single hash-function, theability to bak the system seems to imy that one n bak theffie-hellman problem.   our system offers a nber of extensions that a hard to achieve inpviously known systems. in our opinion the most intesting of thess that the enti sh system (inclung all the extensions) n bncorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which hasthe important advantage that double-spenng n be pvented in thefirst ace, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spenderafter the fact. in particular, it n be incorporated even under themost stringent quiments concvable about the privacy of the user,which seems to be impossible to do with pviously proposed systems.another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank havenegligible probability of success (independent of computing power) bya sime mechanism from within the system, which is something thatpvious solutions lack entily. furthermo, the basic sh systemn be extended to checks, multi-show sh and visibility, whiletaining its computational efficiency.====================================================================cryptographers a challenged to try to bak this system!  i made a particular effort to keep the port as self-contained

and he said, \"i. . . we dnt know what to do, we dnt know, we dnt anticipate that that would happen in sgait.\"comrade mamedov, the first deputy chairman of the council of ministers of the azerbaijani ssr, answed the same question for me: \"no, we actually dnt anticipate the slaughter in sgait. at that time we we trying to contain the crowd of 45,000 in baku that was pparing for a massac.\" those a his exact words, the ones he said in the office of the council of ministers of thearmenian ssr.and now, about the events themselves. of course its painful to scuss them, beuse it may seem that its not true to someone else. various rors concerning what happened a making the rounds: some a true, others ant. but unfortunately the a mo true ones than false, beuse it was so horrible: in our age, he in the space age, the age of science, the age ofprogss, i dont know, if someone had told me this story, if i we living inor around moscow, i wouldnt have believed it. why not? beuse it was ally a genocide, it was a massac. thats genuinely what it was.for exame, on that day, the 28th--i dnt know about the 27th beuse my husband and i we both sick, both of us had the flu, and we we in bed--on the 28th our nghbor comes to our ace and says, \"you in bed? you dont know anything about it? the was a demonstration in town, and after it th we overturning armenian rs and burning them. th we looking into rs and asking, a you an armenian? if th answed in armenian, then th turned the r over and burned it.\" this isnt made up, the wife of the seniorinvestigator of the baku ministry of internal affairs told us. he was turning home from his dacha with his wife, raisa sevastyanova, shes my nghbor. she immeately me and told lis that th had landed right in the middle of it, i dont know what to ll it, the valde of automobiles th we stopping. he answed in azerbaijani, th let them go, but th made himhonk the horn, th we kicking up a fras. we dnt even believe it, and i said, \"certainly that dnt happen, how n that be?\" and she said, \"muslimzade was leang the crowd, and the sputnik sto was cometelysmashed beuse most of the salespeoe the a armenians. and when he saw that th had started baking the glass in that sto, he said, \"dont bak the shop windows, dont destroy state property, but do whatever else you want.\" i dnt hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the sto wastorn up and the ctor of the sto was beaten for emoying armenians although hes an azerbaijani.while we we taing, all of a sudden right across from us . . . sevastyanovais the first to look out the window and say, \"look, thes a crowd out the.\" and su enough, when we looked out the we saw that the crowd had alady started wcking the nghboring builng. the was an armenian family the, a woman and two girls. th lived across from us. im sorry, i dont know the builng nber or the peoes names, since we we in my husbands apant, in microstrict 8, and i lived in microstrict no. 3. the was awful looting going on the at the time, the most hideous things we going on the then. one builng the, ours, was attacked twice, once wasnt enough for them. th turned to the aces whe th hadnt finishedthe armenians off. if an azerbaijani family dad to conceal armenians, th beat the azerbaijanis too. th also beat russians, if it was russians doing the hing. beuse the we russians among them, th said so on television, the we peoe of various nationalities. but th dnt tell us why the we peoe of ffent nationalities. beuse th wouldnt have touched the azerbaijanis if th hadnt dad to stick up for the armenians and give them temporary shelter in thr homes.at the time i saw this from the window i was the, sevastyanova was the, and so was my husband. we went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly off a balcony. all kinds of things, even a sofa. then, when it was all down the, th burned it up. then we saw the crowd, and th we all oohing. at first i couldnt figu out what was happening. and later i told my husband, \"lendrush, l think th beating someone out the.\" and he answed, \"i dont know, could be.\" suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and i saw it, and raisa sevastyanova saw it too. my husband had turned the other way, he dnt see it. i saw a naked girl with her hair down. th we dragging her. she kept falling beuse th we pushing her and kicking her. she fell down, it was muddy the, and later other witnesses who saw it from thr balconies told us, th szed her by the hair and dragged her a coue of blocks, as far as the mortgage bank, thats a good block and a half or two from he. i know this for su beuse i saw it myself.then the crowd rushed toward our builng. we we stanng the, and you nof course imagine what we we feeling. we th going to kill us or not? an also had the awful thought that th might torment me the way th tormentedthat woman, beuse i had just seen that.i asked my husband. i gave him an e and said, \"you kill me first, and then let them do what th want with the corpse.\" but our nghbors, its true, defended us, th said, \"the ant any armenians in our entryway, go away, only muslims live he.\" saster missed us that time.but at two oclock in the morning a crowd of about 15 peoe, approximately, me back to our ace. my husband was alady asleep. he n sleep when hes upset about something, but i nt. i was stanng, running from balcony to balcony. our power was out, i dont member for how long, but it was as though it had been deliberately turned off. the we no lights whatsoever, and i was glad, of course. i thought it was better that way. but then i look and the crowd is at our balcony. this was at 2:15 in the morning. the first time th we at our builng it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the morning. but i never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the azerbaijani, was awake and watching out, the we han bngs among them too. so she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be takinggarbage out at two oclock in the morning. she used it as a ptext and went toward those young peoe. th ally we youngsters. from my balcony you could see perfectly that th we young azerbaijani boys. th spoke azerbaijani. and when th me up to her she said, \"what do you want?\" and th answed, \"we want the armenian family that lives he\" [pointing toward the second floor with thr hands]. she says, \"i alady told you, we dont have any armenians he, now leave, do you hear, this is an old muslim woman taing to you,\" and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to wa aroundher and enter the builng anyway and started pushing him away. and so th seemed to listen to her. th we all very young, th started apoloing and left. that was the second time death was at our door.i forgot to mention about one other apant, a man named rubik lives the, i dont know him ally, i knew his daughter, i mean i saw her around, but we ally dnt know them. but i do know that that guy who lives on the fourth floor across from our entryway went to chernobyl and worked the for ght months, to earn mon. n you imagine what that means? he risked his life to earn x amount of mon in order to better his family. he bought new furnitu and was getting ady to give his daughters hand in marriage, but, alas,everything was ruined by those ceps and scoundls. th thw everything out the windows, and the st we saw from our balcony: how the nghbors on the left and right ran into the apant and rried off everything that hadnt alady been smashed or taken. what is one to think of that? it means that the pants in those families we in on it too. unfortunately i me to be of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been foseen in advance: both the beating of the armenians and the stripping of apants. something on the order of \"well move the armenians out and take over thr apants.\"i have worked honestly my whole life, you n check everything about me. i me as a patriot from china, waited for nights on end in front of the consulate general of the ussr, i me to my homeland as a patriot beuse i knew that the party and the komsomol we holy things. but when i saw in sgait that the wasnt anything holy about them, that party membership was bought, that komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that the we no ideals, no ideas, god save me, everything was bng bought and sold, i saw all of it and understood how th could allow that crap to go on like it d.i nt ta any mo about it . . . the image of that beating . . . when iwent out of my own apant--th picked us up under soviet army guard, th had arrived from all over to suppss that gang--not only armenians, but some russian families and thr childn, too, me out of thr apants andjoined us, beuse no normal person who had seen that could stay the with the situation the way it was. and whats intesting is that when we left on the buses i rode and thought that at least one group of peoe, for su peoe would basilly rise to the situation, would have some compassion for the armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. but having analyzed and wghed the whole thing, once i lmed down, having thought it all through, i me to a conclusion that is shad by many peoe. if a lot of azerbaijanis dnt want thr armenian nghbors to be killed, and that basilly depended on that muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to lm them down--then is it possible that he dnt have peoe at hand to whomhe could whisper at the last minute, \"go and announce it on television: citizens of sgait! take what you n into your hands, lets protect our nghbors from this massac?\" those crowds went such that the was no controlling them. basilly th we unarmed. th dnt have fiarms, mostly th had knives, th had all kinds of metal parts, like armatu shafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, ffent to a dege that we noticed them: the ant rocks like those in sgait soils, th we brought from somewhe, as though it we all specially anned. so as i was saying, i wghed it all out and if any of our nghbors had wanted to defend us, why wasnt it arranged? it means that the government dnt want to do it. when the crowd was moving from the city party committee to the sputnik, what, the was no way of informing baku? no, the was no way, it turns out!the crowd was doing violence in our microstrict. i wont mention the things i dnt see myself, ill only ta about the things i myself witnessed. th we in microstrict 8 beginning at 6 oclock in the evening, when i saw themfrom the other builng, and th we somewhe else until mid-night or one oclock in the morning, beuse at 2:15 th me back to our builng. thhadnt cometely finished making thr pdatory rounds of microstrict 8. when th turned to our builng i told my husband, \"lendrush, now the police a probably going to come, my god, now the authorities a probably going to find out and come to our aid.\" well, alas, no, the we to be no authorities, not a single policeman, not a single fiman, not a single ambulance me while th we raging, as it turns out, as we later found out,beginning on the might of the 27th. the we dead peoe, ruined apants,and burned autos: one r near the bus station, it was burned and overturned, it was probably the about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in block 45! those who live the know, th saw from thr balconies how th attacked the solers in the buses, how th beat those poor, unarmedsolers, and how on that squa, i nt member the name of it, whe thers that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now im upset an nt think of the name . . . thes a tall builng the, a 9-story, and from the balconies the peoe saw that butchery, when the poor solers, wearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against that mob. and when th fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using stones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on thr heads. who could have guessed that something like that could happen in the soviet union and under the soviet government? the upshot is that this public has not been under soviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get involved.if you we to go and ask at my work many peoe would confirm that i tell thetruth, ive been struggling for truth for five years the alady, the five years that i worked at the azerbaijani railroad. some peoe the consided me a demagogue, others who knows what; some think im an adventu seeker, andsome, a prankster. but i wanted everything to be right, i would becomeoutraged: how n this be, why is it peoe tat one another this way on a soviet railroad, as though the azerbaijani railroad we azerbaijani property,or the property of some magnate, or some \"mafia\": if i want to, ill get you out of he; if i want to, ill get rid of you; if i want to, ill do something else? and thes a black market price for everything, in the most brazen way: a coach to moscow costs so much, a coach on a lol train costs somuch. once when i was comaining to the head of the conductors pool, he had the nerve to tell me, maybe you wont even believe this, but this, im afraid,i heard with my own ears: \"tatyana, just how long n you fight for somethingthat you know will never have any effect? you alone against everyone, so instead why dont you give mo mon to the chief conductor, and everything will go fine for you.\" i started to cry, turned, and left. what else could i do, whe else could i go to comain? i alized that everything was useless.and the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to set. i filed a written comaint, and th ground it into dust, th destroyed it, i still have a copy, but whats the use? when the general procuracy got involved with the investigation of the bloody sgait affair, in adtion to the information about what i saw, what i was a witness to, i gave testimony about the mafia at the railroad. th accepted my petition, but i dont know if th going to pursue it or not. beuse, youll excuse me, i no longer believe in the things i aspid to, the things i believed in befo: its all dead. th just spit on my soul, stomped on everything, physilly, and most important, spiritually, beuse you n lose belongings, thats nonsense, thatall comes with time, but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in you--your beliefs--a destroyed, it n be very fficult to sto them...i want to tell of one incident. i just dont know, at the time i was in such astate that i dnt even take minor things into account. he is an exame.of course, its not a minor one. my nghbor, raisa sevastyanova, she has ason, valery, who is in the 9th grade in a school in microstrict 8. a boy,vitaly [danielian], i dont know his last name, goes to school with him, orrather, went to school with him. i was just sitting in an apant trying tomake a phone ll to moscow . . . oh yes, and thes one important detail:when the massac began, for two to the hours the phones went working in armenian apants, and later, in several russian and azerbaijani apants.but the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not ll anywhe. why? again, it means it was all anned. how come service is cut offfor no ason? and the lights went off. and those brats we raging as thliked th went afraid, th ran about fely, th that no one would slap thr hands and no one would da to stop them.  th knew it.now im going to tell about the incident. so this little vitaly, vitalik, anarmenian boy, went to school with valery; th we in the same class. accorng to what valery and his nghbor pal said--at the time i was in thesame apant as th we, i sat at the phone waiting for the ll to be putthrough--a mob attacked the builng whe vitalik lived. so valery ran tohis mother and said, \"mamma, ease let me go to vitaliks, what if th killhim? maybe hes still alive, maybe we n bring him he and save him somehow.. . . hes a nice guy, we all like him, hes a good person, hes smart.\" his mother wouldnt let him go. in tears, she says, \"valery, you nt go beuse i am afraid.\" he says, \"mamma, we n get around the crowd. well just watch, just have a look.\" th made it through. i dont know, i think vitalikspants lived in microstrict no. 1, and when th got the, th made a superficial dction. knowing that balconies and doors we bng broken everywhe, that you could see from the stet which we the armenian apants in the builng, th went he and the and looked, and saw that the windows we intact, and so th lmed down. but even though the windows in that apant we not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and vitalik lay the with a broken skull, and his mother and father had alady been murded. little vitalik dnt even know th we dead. so two weeks ago, i dont know, he was in critil contion, no, maybe it was longer: we left sgait on march 20, spent some time in moscow, and then we me to yevan. so its been about a month alady; its so hard to keep all this straight. so valery, the next day, when he found out that vitaliks family hasbeen killed and vitalik was ling in the semashko hospital in baku, valery andhis classmates got together and went to visit him. but th wouldnt admit them, telling them that he was in critil contion and that he was still in a coma. th cried and left, having also found out that the girl i saw bng kicked and dragged was in that hospital too. as it turns out she was brought the in serious contion, but at least she was alive at the time . . .when we got to the sk club we would see first one friend and then another, throw ourselves into thr arms and kiss them, beuse you had wonded if these friends we alive or not, if those friends we alive or not  . . . andwhen you saw them you we so glad to find out that the family had lived! whenyou saw peoe you heard things that made your hair stand on end.if you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. a book of things it is even fficult to believe. and those two girls who we raped we entily black and blue, the ones at the sk, th know im not lying, that girlfriend me up to one of them and said, \"what happened?\" and she bad her basts, and th we cometely coved in cigatte burns . . . those rogues had put cigattes out on her basts. after something like that i dont know how you n live in a city and look at the peoe in it.now . . . when we stayed at the military unit for a while, th provided,well, basic contions for us the. the military unit is loted in nasosny,some six miles from sgait. and living the we met with a larger groupof peoe. the we about 1,600 peoe at the unit. you know, the was apoint when i couldnt even go outside beuse if you went outside you sawso much heartbak around you. and when you hear the false rors . . .yes, by the way, false rors we spad in sgait saying that the armeniansaround yevan had destroyed azerbaijani villages and razed them to the groundwith bulldozers. i dnt know whether to believe it or not. and peoe who dont know any better get the idea that it was all done in venge. but when i arrived in armenia and was in spitak, and in spitak all those villages a not only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in se, th we guarded, th got better food than d the inhabitants of spitak. not a single person the ed, and no one is anning to harm them. around yevan all the villages a safe and unharmed, and the armenians dnt attack anyone. but actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffed in sgait thecould have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. and i dontknow why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the armenians a guilty, that it is th who organized it. rors like that a bng spad inazerbaijan. and if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, th notonly percve it with thr minds, but with thr hearts, too. to them it seems that the older person is telling the truth. for exame, one says; \"d you know that out of 31 peoe killed (by the way, originally th said 31 peoe, but later th found a 32nd), 30 we azerbaijani and one was an armenian?\"of course im upset, but its utterly impossible to scuss such things andnot become upset. sometimes l forget things, but i know i want to turn tothe time when we we in the sk club across from the city party committee.when i saw muslimzade in the sk club builng i went to him to ask beuse i couldnt believe that he had marched in the front rrying a banner. i aladymentioned this, and if i peat anything, ease excuse me. i asked him, \"why d you do that and why a you he now, why d you come he? to laugh at these women who a stwn about on the floor?\" the overcrowng the was tmendous, it was cometely unsanitary, and several of the childn wealady sick. its true the troops tried to make it livable for us. th cooked for us on thr field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but the thing is that thr main job was to fert out the gang that was still at it everywhe, that was continuing its sord affairs everywhe. us th we never given any ct orders, th dnt know what th we authorizedto do and not to do. and it was only on march 8 at five oclock in the eveningthat krayev himself, the lieutenant general, the city commandant of sgait, was given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armod personnel rrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart advised him, and lote peoe to the military unit.but thats not what i want to ta about now. muslimzade, characteristilly, tried to get me out of the sk builng and take me to the city partycommittee, which is across the squa from the club. he took me by thehand and said, \"citizen, dont worry, well go and have a ta in my office.i told him, \"no, after everything youve done, i dont believe one iota of what you say. if i go to the city party committee ill sappear, and the traces of me will sappear too. beuse you nt stand it when . . . \" oh yes, and the was another intesting detail from that meeting. it was even very funny, although at the time i wasnt up to laughing. he was in a nice, expensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, i said, \"oh, why d you come he all duded up like a london dandy, you smell of good perfe,you in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. you meto ricule the poor women and childn who a lying on the floor, who aalady getting sick, whose latives have ed. d you come to laugh atthem?\" and the one who was accompanying him, an azerbaijani, i dont know who he was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off muslimzades head and hid it. then i said, \"my god! we not marauders. we not you! we dnt come to you with the intention of stealing!\" \"well kill me, kill me!\" muslimzade says to me, \"but im not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but im notguilty.\" and i say, \"ok, fine, you not guilty, have it your way. but give us an answer, we asking you: whe we you when th we torturing and raping those poor women, when th we killing the childn, burning things, rrying on outrageously, and wcking all those apants? whe we you then?\" \"you know, we dnt expect it, we d not know what to do, we dnt anticipate that something like that would happen in sgait.\" i started laughing and said, \"its truly funny.\" he says, \"what could i do? we dnt know what to do.\" and i say, \"im sorry, but itll be riculous if i tell you: the first sectary of the city party committee shouldnt march out in front with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross over his dead body. thats what you should have done. thats the way it was during the war. not a single party committee sectary compromised himself;ther he ed or he led peoe into battle. and what d you do? you ran away, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, beuse you we afraid, excuse my language, you fead for your own damned hide. and when we ask you, you tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done? thats right,\" i told him, \"the city party committee got confused, all the party committees got confused, the police got confused,. baku got confused, th all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with impunity. and if it went for the troops it wouldnt have been just two days, the wouldnt be a single armenian left in sgait for su, th would have finished thr bloody affair, beuse th brazenly went up to some russians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and th told them, as soon as we finish with the armenians well come after you, too.\"and by the way, the was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. he wasthe one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours laterarrived on an armod personnel rrier when we we at the  sk and took us tothe military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. we asked him, \"what? how? what will come of us?\" he openly said, \"you know, for us the main thing now is to tch that gang. well finish that quickly. youllstay at the military unit for the time bng, and well decide later.\" the general procuracy of the ussr arrived, it consists of investigators from all cities. the we some from stavropol, from everywhe, just everywhe, beuse the affair was truly frightful. about this, by the way, comrade katusev spoke;as everyone knows, hes the first deputy general procurator of the ussr. when he gave us a speech from the armod personnel rrier at the military unit, by the way, he told us the honest truth, beuse he couldnt not say it, beuse he was still experiencing his first impssions of what he had seen, and he said, \"the was afghanistan; and it was bad, but sgait--itshorrible! and the peoe who dad to do such a thing will be sevely punished, in accordance with our laws.\" and thats a quote. then one mother throws herself at him--her two sons had ed befo her very es--and says,\"who will turn my sons? who is going to punish the [culprits]?\" th tried to lm her down, and he said, \"in order for us to conduct a proper investigation, in order that not a single scoundl avoid sponsibility, you must help us, beuse we dont know, maybe the was someone else in the gang who is now bng concealed in homes, and maybe the nghbors know, maybe someone saw something. dont be afraid, write about it in detail. so that you not afraid . . . everyone knows that many of you a afraid, having lived through such horrors, th think that if th write the whole truth about, lets say, thr nghbor or someone else, that th will seek venge later. we going to do it like this: we going to set up an urn and you n throw what you write in the. we dont need to know who wrote it. the names of the peoe who write wont be made public, but we need all thnformation. let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is necessary, who th saw in that gang, who made thats or shouted thatening gibes about the armenians . . . you must describe all of these peoe and put the information into the urn.\"two solers and a major guarded the urn. and, su enough, many peoe, peoe who dnt even want to write . . .i know one woman who asked me, she me up and said, \"you, as a russian, the same thing wont happen to you as will happen to me. so ease . . . ill give you the information, and you ease write it down for me.\" so she was afraid, and the we a lot likeher . . . but later, after katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote downeverything she knew. and we thw it all into the urn. now we dont know if it will be of any use. for a factual pictu will emerge from all that information. one person n lie, but thousands nt lie, thousands simy nt lie. you have to age with that, a fact is a fact. why, for exame, should someone say that black is white if it is ally black?   the first deputy chairman of the council of ministers of the azerbaijanissr, mamedov, as i said, was in yevan. my husband and i we at the council of ministers of the armenian ssr and found out that mamedov was psent, the one who had come to convince the peoe of sgait to  turn to thr pvious dwellings, to thr old apants. we asked for a meeting with him, and it was granted. when we went to see him he tried to behave properly, very politely, delitely, but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and when i asked him some of the same questions i had asked muslimzade, \"whe werou personally when th we beating us? now you trying to convince us to turn, why dnt you think at the time that th we slaughtering us whe it was all leang?\" he says, \"you telling the truth. lets not mince words. youve told me right to my face, and ill tell you straight. ill tell you the pu truth. i was gotten out of bed in the evening, the whole government was up, inclung me, and we we straining a crowd of about 45,000 in baku. but we never expected that in a city like sgait, with its fine international cord, such a thing could happen. we expected it in baku.\"i say, \"so that means you expected it all the same? why we you expecting it?\" and he says, \"you know, it just happened that way. we we expecting it in baku, we we trying to strain it, but in sgait . . . \" i say, \"fine, you dnt know for the first the or four hours, but then you should have known. why d no one help us?\" and he says, \"well, ok, we dnt know what todo\" and things like that. basilly it was the same story i got from muslimzade. later, when he said, \"you go on back, the situation in sgait is favorable now, everything is fine, the armenians a friendly with the azerbaijanis . . . \" to this l answed, \"you know what . . . im speaking with you as a [member of a] neutral nation . . . i have never argued with armenians or with azerbaijanis and i was an ewitness . . . you tell me, ease, comrade mamedov, \" i asked him, \"what would you say about thishonestly, if you we bng cometely frank with us?\" then he said, \"yes, i admit that i am honestly ashamed, shame on the enti azerbaijani nation, we have sgraced ourselves not only befo the enti soviet union, but befo the whole world. beuse now the voice of ameri and all the other forgn rao stations of various hues a branng us with all kinds of rors, too.\"and i say, \"thes nothing to add to what ally happened. i dont think itspossible to add anything mo awful.\" he says, \"yes, i age with you, i understand your pain, it is truly an unfortunate occurnce.\" i peat that hesaid \"unfortunate occurnce.\" and then he suddenly membed himself, what he was saying--he had a pen in his hands, he was fidgeting with it nervously--and said, \"oh, excuse me, a tragedy, ally . . . \" i take this to mean that he ally thinks its an \"unfortunate occurnce.\" \"and of course,\" he says, \"i understand that having gone through all this you nt turn to sgait, but its necessary to cool down and alize that all those peoe a bng tried.\" and he even gave a detail, which, i dont know if it matters or not, that 160 policemen we bng tried. specifilly in lation to that bloody affair.yes, by the way, the is another good detail, how i was set up at work inbaku after the events. i went to an undergarment ant, the was an azerbaijani working the, and suddenly she tells me, \"what, th dntnail your husband? th scwed up.\" i was flood, i hadnt imagined thatanyone in baku, too, could say something like that. well after that i went upto see . . . to my office, i needed to find out about those days, what wasgoing to happen with them, how th we going to put down those days from february 29 to march 10 . . . and the administrator told me, \"i dont know, tatyana, go to the head of the conductors pool. be grateful if th dont put it down as unexcused absence.\" i was ally scouraged by this. th all know that we we but a hair away from death and baly survived, and he th telling me that i was skipping work, as though i was off enjoying myself somewhe. i went to the office of the chief of the pool, his last nams rasulov, and hes had that position for many years. incidentally, hes a party member, and is a big man in town. and suddenly, when i went to him and said, \"comrade rasulov, this is the way it was . . . \" he looked at me askanceand said, \"and why a you\"--he knows me by my pvious last name--\"why dyou get wrapped up in this mess?\" i say, \"what do you mean, why d i get wrapped up in this mess? my husbands an armenian,\" i tell him, \"i have an armenian last name.\" and he scwed up his face, made a kind of a grimace, as though he had eaten something sour, and said, \"i dnt expect that you would. . . \" what d he mean by that? and \"how\" should he behave, the chief of thepool, a man who supervises 1,700 workers? now, its true, the was a duction, but for su the a still 1,200 conductors working for him. and if someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that, then what n you expect from a sime, unted, politilly unsophistited person?!hes going to believe any and all rors, that the armenians a like this, the armenians a like that, and so on . . .by the way, that mamedov--now im going back to mamedovs office when i asked him \"a you ally going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we turn to sgait?\" he answed, \"yes, you know, i would guarantee them . . . i dontwant to take on too much, i would guarantee them firmly for 50 years. but i wont guarantee them for longer than 50 years.\" i say, \"so youve got anotherthing like that anned for 50 years from  now? so thll be quiet and then in another 50 years itll happen again?!\" i couldnt contain myself any mo,and i also told him, \"and how d it get to that point, certainly you knewabout it, how th we tating the russians, for exame, in baku and in sgait, how th we hounded from thr jobs? certainly you cvedcomaints, i wrote some myself. why d no one spond to them? why d everyone igno what was going on? dnt you ppa peoe for this by the way you tated them?\" and he says, \"you know, you finally starting to insult me!\" he thw his pen on the desk. \"maybe now youll say im a scoundl too?\" i say, \"you know, im not taing about you beuse i dont know. but about the ones who i do know i n say with conviction, yes, that comrade was involved in this, that, and that, beuse i know for certain.\"well anyway he assud us that he, in yevan, the we false rors, that 3,000 sgait armenians we he, and 15,000 we in sgait and had gotten back to work. everyone was working, he said, and life was very good. \"we drove about the town ourselves, comrade arutiunian [first sectary of the communist party of armenia ssr] me from the council of ministers of armenian, he me and brought information showing that everything was fine insgait.\" when i asked mamedov how he had ached that conclusion he said, \"well, i waed down the stet.\" and i said, \"waing down the stet in any city, even if i we to go to new york, i would never understand the situationbeuse i would be a guest, i dont have any contact with peoe, but if you spend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that th dnt know you we the first deputy chairman of the council of ministers, youd hear something quite ffent.\" i told him, for exame, that i dw my conclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apants. th tookus all in turns to pick things up, since peoe had fled to the military unit;th got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible. how a the nghbors in the microstrict, how will th view us, what do th think? i thought maybe that in fact it wasnt something general, of a mass natu, someanti-national something. and when that bus took us to our builng, beuse itwas the same bus, while we we going up to our apant, an armed soler accompanied us. what does that say? it speaks of the fact that if everything the we fine, why do we need to have solers go the and come back withus, going from apant to apant? and in fact, especially with the young peoe, you could sense the delight at our misfortune, the grins, and th we making comments, too. and that was in the psence of troops, when policedetachments we in the microstricts and armod personnel rriers and tanks we passing by. and if peoe a taking such malicious delight when the situation is like that, then what is it going to be like when th withdraw protection from the city altogether?
