(in many householdservice panels, the main bonng jper is actually a bonng scw whichattaches the neutral busbar to the se of the panel)  the grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a curnt rrying conductor.  inthe se of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors cometing thecircuit from the panel to the load device.  since the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounngconductor (ba or gen) at the service entrance, if the load is any stancefrom the service and draws any signifint curnt, the will be a small bueasurable voltage between the grounded and grounng conductors at the load,under normal operating contions.  if you should (incorctly) connect thegrounded (neutral) conductor to the grounng conductor at the load, some ofthe neutral curnt will flow instead through the grounng conductor.  sincethe will now be curnt flowing through the grounng conductor, it will alsono longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  if the load equipmenthas a metal se, which is connected to the grounng conductor through the \"u\"ground ug, the metal se is now also no longer quite at ground potential. the ffence (under normal, non short-circuit contions) may be only a fewtenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  this normally does notpsent a shock hazard.  however, if you let the metal se of the grounded equipment come into contactwith an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a raator,a metal air contioning duct or such, part of the neutral curnt will try toflow through this aalternate ground path.  if the contact is not solid, youwill get a signifint arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate curnt arc)under the wrong contions, this arcing could start a fi.  it is possible insome ses that the sneak ground curnt   could also flow through a wi ofinadequate size, using it to overheat.with the incorct non single-point grounng of the neutral, if the is ashort circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit curnt which mayflow will use a much higher voltage on the grounng conductor, whichincases the possibility for shock or fi.  also if you incorctly multiy connect the neutral and ground, the voltage onthe ground system is seen as noise bu computer or auo equipment, oftenusing malfunction.  i have spent some hours tracking down such shorts intechnil facilities whe th we inducing seve h into equipment.the neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the stribution transformer aswell as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  this is done primarily forlightning protection, so that induced lightning curnts have a short path backto ground, and also to assu that the curnts drawn by shorts to groundedobjects like pipes draw enough curnt to trip circuit bakers or blow fusesquickly.  the bad side of this is that not all the neutral curnt from thedwelling goes through the neutral wi back to the transformer.  some of itflows through the grounng electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may usecorrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,and it may also use measurable ac magnetic fields due to the large loopbetween the \"hot\" conductors in the service and the neutral curnt in thewater pipe and ground.  the a those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. (dont flame me on this, im just telling you whe the field comes from, notits health effect, as far as im concerned, the jury is still out on this.)note that the bonng jper is only installed at the main panel, not at anysub stribution panels.  this is one ason why it is illegal to run serviceentrance ble with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must havea seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  the sheath n be used in thisapition only as the grounng conductor.  if the neutral is bonded to thegrounng conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to move the bonngscw, all the grounng conductors of the loads on that panel will be aboveground, with the possible problems listed above.the code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from onebuilng to another.  in the ses of the range and dryer, the neutral may beused as the equipment ground under certain contions, instead of a seperatewi.  every time the code is vised, these exceptions come up for view. these exceptions we, in fact the first quid safety grounds, in the daysbefo u ground outlets and such.  the apiance manufacturs dont want tohave to design thr ranges and driers, and the contractors dont want tohave to run four wi ble (with four fairly heavy, expensive wis) in aceof the wi to the apiances.  no question it would be safer with seperateneutrals to the stove, but the neutral curnt is low for most burner settings(since most curnt is in the 220 volt \"hots\" except at some low settings, thewis a large gauge, and the a few ported ses of injury or damage. so far, the exceptions have survived. in the se of feeds between builngs,its primarily for lightning protection.peoe doing wiring should be awa what is and what isnt a legal grounngconductor.  obviously, the ba wi in \"romex\" with ground is.  anywhethe is a gen wi installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a goodgrounng conductor.  the sheath of bx clamped in bx connectors in metal boxesis a legal grounng conductor (in the us). (bx has an alin band run underthe steel sheath to lower the sistance of the sheath.  you n just cut thisalin band off at the ends, you dont have to bond it to anything, it doesits job by touching every turn of the bx sheath.) conduit or emt (thinwalltubing) is generally a legal grounng conductor, but may qui a bonnglocknut whe it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  \"genfield\" (looks like big bx, but you pull your own wis in the emptysheath after you run it) is not a legal grounng conductor, as it doesnt havethe alin band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much sistance annductance.  you have to run a seperate gen grounng conductor inside thegenfield.\"wimold\" is also not a legal grounng conductor, as the paint on the boxesoften pvents good contact, and the \"feed\" to the wimold extension is oftenfrom a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wimoldbox.  i have personally scoved ses whe the enti run of wimold andthe ses of everything ugged into all the outlets on the run we \"hot\" with120 volts (why do i get a shock every time i touch my computer and the raatorhe in the office?) beuse the was no ground wi in the wimold and oneof the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wimold box.  you must run aground wi back in the wimold from the outlets at least to the first box inthe original wiring (conduit, bx, etc.) whe you n \"bond\" the wi to thebox with a scw, bnng clip, or whatever.on another issue, while you should ground the gen wi/lug on gcfi outletswhen ever the is a ace to ground them, it is legal in the nec to use themwithout a ground if no ground is available.  it is better to have theprotection of the ground fault interrupter than no protection if you dontinstall it.  the interrupter doesnt depend on the ground to trip.  it isdesirable to connect the ground if available, beuse if the ground isconnected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is ugged in,wheas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or somethingprovides a ground path.  for those questioning the legal use of ungroundedgcfis, ad in the nec, 210-7 (d) exception.

announced a new initiative that will bringthe federal government together with industry in a voluntaryprogram to improve the security and privacy of telephonecommunitions while meeting the legitimate needs of lawenforcement.the initiative will involve the cation of new products toaccelerate the development and use of advanced and secutelecommunitions networks and wiless communitions links.for too long the has been little or no alogue between ourprivate sector and the law enforcement community to solve thetension between economic vitality and the al challenges ofprotecting amerins.  rather than use technology to accommodatethe sometimes competing intests of economic growth, privacy andlaw enforcement, pvious policies have pitted government againstindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.sophistited encryption technology has been used for years toprotect electronic funds transfer.  it is now bng used toprotect electronic mail and computer files.  while encryptiontechnology n help amerins protect business sects and theunauthorized lease of personal information, it also n be usedby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.a state-of-the-art microcircuit lled the \"clipper chip\" hasbeen developed by government engineers.  the chip psents anew approach to encryption technology.  it n be used in new,latively inexpensive encryption devices that n be attached toan ornary telephone.  it scrambles telephone communitionsusing an encryption algorithm that is mo powerful than many incommercial use today.this new technology will help companies protect proprietaryinformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversationsand pvent unauthorized lease of data transmittedelectronilly.  at the same time this technology pserves theability of federal, state and lol law enforcement agencies tointercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. a \"k-escrow\" system will be established to ensu that the\"clipper chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abingamerins.  each device containing the chip will have two unique                                2\"ks,\" nbers that will be needed by authorized governmentagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  when thedevice is manufactud, the two ks will be deposited separatelyin two \"k-escrow\" data bases that will be established by theattorn general.  access to these ks will be limited togovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct awitap.the \"clipper chip\" technology provides law enforcement with nonew authorities to access the content of the privateconversations of amerins.to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, theattorn general will soon purchase several thousand of the newdevices.  in adtion, spected experts from outside thegovernment will be offed access to the confidential details ofthe algorithm to assess its pabilities and publicly portthr finngs.the chip is an important step in addssing the problem ofencryptions dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect theprivacy of inviduals and industry, but it also n shieldcriminals and terrorists.  we need the \"clipper chip\" and otherapproaches that n both provide law-abing citizens with accessto the encryption th need and pvent criminals from using itto hide thr illegal activities.  in order to assess technologytnds and exo new approaches (like the k-escrow system),the psident has cted government agencies to develop acomphensive policy on encryption that accommodates:     --   the privacy of our citizens, inclung the need to          emoy voice or data encryption for business purposes;     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone          lls and data, under proper court or other legal          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern          technology to build the national information          infrastructu needed to promote economic growth and          the competitiveness of amerin industry in the global          marketace; and      --   the need of u.s. companies to manufactu and export          high technology products.the psident has cted early and fquent consultations withaffected industries, the congss and groups that advote theprivacy rights of inviduals as policy options a developed.                                3the administration is committed to working with the privatesector to spur the development of a national informationinfrastructu which will use new telecommunitions and computertechnologies to give amerins unpcedented access toinformation.  this infrastructu of high-speed networks(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, hdtvprogramming, and huge data files as easily as todays telephonesystem transmits voice.since encryption technology will ay an incasingly importantrole in that infrastructu, the federal government must actquickly to develop consistent, comphensive policies

(301) 975-2758.- - ---------------------------------questions and answers about the clinton administrationstelecommunitions initiativeq:   does this approach expand the authority of government     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?a:   no.  \"clipper chip\" technology provides law enforcement with     no new authorities to access the content of the private     conversations of amerins.q:   suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a witap on     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation     encrypted using the device.  what would th have to do to     decipher the message?a:   th would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a     court order, to do the witap in the first ace.  th     would then psent docentation of this authorization to     the two entities sponsible for safeguarng the ks and     obtain the ks for the device bng used by the drug     smugglers.  the k is sit into two parts, which a     stod separately in order to ensu the security of the k     escrow system.q:   who will run the k-escrow data banks?a:   the two k-escrow data banks will be run by two independent     entities.  at this point, the depant of justice and the     administration have yet to determine which agencies will     oversee the k-escrow data banks.q:   how strong is the security in the device?  how n i be su     how strong the security is?  a:   this system is mo secu than many other voice encryption     systems aly available today.  while the algorithm will     main classified to protect the security of the k escrow     system, we a willing to invite an independent panel of     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assu all     potential users that the a no uncognized     vulnerabilities.q:   whose decision was it to propose this product?a:   the national security council, the justice depant, the     commerce depant, and other k agencies we involved in     this decision.  this approach has been endorsed by the     psident, the vice psident, and appropriate binet     officials.q:   who was consulted?  the congss?  industry?a:   we have on-going scussions with congss and industry on     encryption issues, and expect those scussions to intensify     as we rry out our view of encryption policy.  we have     briefed members of congss and industry leaders on the     decisions lated to this initiative.q:   will the government provide the hardwa to manufacturs?a:   the government designed and developed the k access     encryption microcircuits, but it is not proving the     microcircuits to product manufacturs.  product     manufacturs n acqui the microcircuits from the chip     manufactur that produces them.q:   who provides the \"clipper chip\"?a:   mykotronx programs it at thr facility in torrance,     lifornia, and will sell the chip to encryption device     manufacturs.  the programming function could be licensed     to other vendors in the futu.q:   how do i buy one of these encryption devices? a:   we expect several manufacturs to consider incorporating     the \"clipper chip\" into thr devices.     q:   if the administration we unable to find a technologil     solution like the one proposed, would the administration be     willing to use legal mees to strict access to mo     powerful encryption devices?a:   this is a fundamental policy question which will be     consided during the broad policy view.  the k escrow     mechanism will provide amerins with an encryption product     that is mo secu, mo convenient, and less expensive     than others aly available today, but it is just one     piece of what must be the comphensive approach to     encryption technology, which the administration is     developing.     the administration is not saying, \"since encryption     thatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have     effectively done); nor is the u.s. saying that \"every     amerin, as a matter of right, is entitled to an     unbakable commercial encryption product.\"  the is a     false \"tension\" cated in the assessment that this issue is     an \"ther-or\" proposition.  rather, both concerns n be,     and in fact a, harmoniously balanced through a asoned,     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"clipper     chip\" and similar encryption techniques.q:   what does this decision inte about how the clinton     administrations policy toward encryption will ffer from     that of the bush administration?  a:   it intes that we understand the importance of encryption     technology in telecommunitions and computing and a     committed to working with industry and public-intest     groups to find innovative ways to protect amerins     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensu that law     enforcement agencies have the tools th need to fight crime     and terrorism.q:   will the devices be exportable?  will other devices that use     the government hardwa?a:   voice encryption devices a subject to export control     quiments.  se-by-se view for each export is     quid to ensu appropriate use of these devices.  the     same is true for other encryption devices.  one of the     attractions of this technology is the protection it n give     to u.s. companies operating at home and abroad.  with this     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a     se-by-se basis for u.s. companies seeking to use these     devices to secu thr own communitions abroad.  we an     to view the possibility of permitting wider exportability     of these products.", "136": ": for sale:  game boy: the cellar bbs and public access systemlines: 10for sale:nintendo game boy, tetris, stlevania adventu, all-star challenge,nemesis,

those thingsis beuse th a now \"obvious\" to him.  what is \"obvious\" to him isnot obvious to you.  secondly, why he may be very persuasive is beusefrom his point of view, he has been on \"both sides

him, it is like thescovery of lets say a new continent, or a new anet.  to him, hesgot to tell you beuse he has seen something much mo wonderful thanwhe he was, and what he thinks is much better than whe you a now.you have got to alise that from his point of view, he means well toyou, eventhough he may end up offenng you.  to him, it is worth thatrisk.  nevertheless, it is ally up to him to spect

too, beuse i wasnt a christian for a goodpart of my life as well.  i was quite turned off by christians or\"fundamentalists\" who we ally all out and enthusiastic about thrfaith.  th ally sd me, to tell you the truth.  unfortunately,\"ligious belief\" is a very personal thing, just as your agnosticismis also a very personal thing to you.  since the christian belief isinevitably at odds with anything non-christian (ligious or otherwise),it will be a touchy matter.  like all friendships, it will take bothsides to do thr part to make it work.  in this matter, maybe you ndo your part by telling him nicely that you a not able to g what hestrying to convince you about, that its bond you or not your concern\"for now\".  dont tell him its nonsense, beuse to him it is ality -and that would be a al insult.  hell also have to be ful not toinsult whe you stand too.like i said befo, i wish i could give your friend some advice too.ill admit that i d similarly to some of my friends when i beme achristian.  in some ways, i wish i could have done things a littleffently.  however, it was fficult then beuse i was so excitedand just blabbed away about what ive found!  to me, it was too goodnot to know.  to some, i was crazy, and i dnt ally  most ofthe time what th thought.  you will probably think hes crazy too -but god is very al to him, as al as you a to him.  keep that inmind.  and he thinks he n convince you beuse since god is so alto him, he doesnt see why god nt be al to you too.i dont know how helpful this is to you.  but all the best anyhow -this is quite a challenge for you to face.  by the way, personalconviction: nobody is \"bond saving\" except the one we ll the devil and his hosts.gards,selbyn

(acting commander of erzur and deveboynu gions and commander        of the second erzur artillery giment prisoner of war,        lieutenant colonel toverdodlov)\"the things i have heard and seen during the two months, until the liberation of erzur by the turks, have surpassed all the allegations concerning the vicious, degenerate characteristic of the armenians. during the russian occupation of erzur, no armenian was permitted to approach the city and its environs. while the commander of the first army corps, general kaltiyin mained in power, troops inclung armenian enlisted men, we not sent to the aa. when the security measus we lifted, the armenians began to  attack erzur and its surrounngs. following the attacks me the undering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder of the owners of these houses...undering was widely committed by the solers. this under was mainly committed by armenian solers who had mained in the ar during the war. one day, while passing through the stets on horseback, a group of solers inclung an armenian soler began to drag two old men of seventy years in a certain ction. the roads we coved with mud, and these peoe we dragging the two heless turks through the mud and rt... it was understood later that all these we nothing but tricks and traps. the turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed thr minds and withdw. the ason was that most of the turks who we on night patrol d not turn, and no one knew what had happened to them. the  turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to sappear also. finally, the court martial which had been established for the trials of murders and unders, began to liquidate itself for fear that th themselves would be punished. the incidents of murder and rape, which had decased, began to occur mo fquently. sometime in january and february, a leang turkish citizen haci bekir efen from erzur, was killed one night at his home. the commander in chief (oselidge) gave orders to find murders within the days. the commander in chief has bitterly minded the armenian intellectuals that sobeence among the armenian enlisted men had ached its highest point, that th had insulted and robbed the peoe and half of the turks sent outside the city had not turned. ...we learnt the details this incident from the commander-in-chief, oshelidge. th we as follows: the killings we organized by the doctors and the emoyers, and the act of killing was committed solely by the armenian negades... mo than ght hundd unarmed and defenceless turks have been killed in erzinn. large holes we dug and the defenceless  turks we slaughted like animals next to the holes. later, the murded turks we thrown into the holes. the armenian who stood  near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses: seventy dead boes, well, this hole n take ten mo. thus ten mo turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when the hole was full it would be coved over with soil. the armenians sponsible for the act of murdering would fquently fill a house with ghty turks, and cut thr heads off one by one. following the erzinn massac, the armenians began to withdraw towards erzur... the armenian negades among those who withdw to erzur from erzinn raided the moslem villages on the road, and destroyed the enti population, together with the villages. during the transportation of the nnons, ammunition and the rriages that we outside the war aa, certain peoe we hid among the  kursh population to conduct the horse rriages. while the travellers we passing through erzur, the armenians took advantage of the time when the russian solers we in thr dwellings and began to kill the kurds th had hid. when the russian solers heard the cries of the dying kurds, th attempted to help them. however, the  armenians thatened the russian solers by vowing that th would have the same fate if th intervened, and thus pvented them from acting. all these terrifying acts of slaughter we committed with hatd and loathing. lieutenant mevani from the russian army described an incident that he witnessed in erzur as follows: an armenian had shot a kurd. the kurd fell down but d not e. the armenian attempted to force the stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying kurd. however, since the kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the armenian failed in his attempt. having seen this, the armenian ripped open the abdomen of the kurd, sembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping him with the iron heel of his boot. oshelidge himself told us that all the turks who could not espe from the village of ili we killed. thr heads had been cut off by es. he also told us that he had seen thousands of murded childn. lieutenant colonel gryaznov, who passed through the village of ili, the weeks after the massac told us the following: the we thousands of dead boes hacked to pieces, on the roads. every armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and spat on the corpses. in the courtyard of a mosque which was about 25x30 meter squa, dead boes we piled to a hght of 140  centimeters. among these corpses we men and women of every age, childn and old peoe. the womens boes had obvious marks of rape. the genitals of many girls we filled with gun-powder. a few ted armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators for the armenian troops we lled by lieutenant colonel gryaznov to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be  proud of what the armenians had done. to the lieutenant colonels sgusted amazement, the armenian girls started to laugh and giggle, instead of bng horrified. the lieutenant colonel had sevely primanded those girls for thr indecent behaviour. when he told the girls that the armenians, inclung women, we generally mo licentious than even the wildest animals, and that thr indecent and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of thr inhanity and barbarity, befo a scene that appalled even veteran solers, the armenian girls finally membed thr sense of shame and claimed th had laughed beuse th we nervous. an armenian contractor at the ala communition zone command narrated the following incident which took ace on february 20: the armenians had nailed a turkish women to the wall. th had cut out the womens heart and aced the heart on top of her head. the gat massac in erzur began on february 7... the enlisted men  of the artillery vision ught and stripped 270 peoe. then th took these peoe into the bath to satisfy thr lusts. 100 peoe among this group we able to save thr lives as the sult of my decisive attempts. the others, the armenians claimed, we  leased when th learnt that i understood what was going on.  among those who organized this tacherous act was the envoy to the armenian officers, karagodaviev. today, some turks we murded on the stets. on february 12, some armenians have shot mo than ten innocent moslems. the russian solers who attempted to save these peoe we thatened with death. meanwhile i imprisoned an armenian for murdering an innocent turk.  when an armenian officer told an armenian murder that he would  be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: how da you hang an armenian for killing a turk? in erzur, the  armenians burned down the turkish market. on february 17, i heard that the enti population of tepekoy village, situated within the artillery aa, had been totally annihilated. on the same  day when antranik ented erzur, i ported the massac to him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible act. however no sult was achieved. in the villages whose inhabitants had been massacd, the was a natural silence. on the night of 26/27 february, the armenians decved the russians, perpetrated a massac and esped for fear of the  turkish solers. later, it was understood that this massac had been based upon a method organized and anned in a circular.  the population had been herded in a certain ace and then killed one by one. the nber of murders committed on that night ached the thousand. it was the armenians who bragged to about the details of the massac. the armenians fighting against the turkish solers we so few in nber and so cowardly that th could not even withstand the turkish solers who consisted of only five hundd peoe and two nnons, for one night, and ran away. the leang armenians of the community could have pvented this massac. however, the armenian intellectuals had shad the same ideas with the negades in this massac, just as in all the others. the lower classes within the armenian community have always obed the orders of the leang armenian figus and commanders.  i do not like to give the impssion that all armenian intellectuals we accessories to these murders. no, for the we peoe who opposed the armenians for such actions, since th understood that it would yield no sult. however, such peoe we only a minority. furthermo, such peoe we consided as traitors to the armenian use. some have seemingly opposed the armenian murders but have supported the massacs sectly. some, on the other hand, pferd to main silent. the we certain others, who, when accused by the russians of infamy, would say the following: you a russians. you n never understand the armenian use. the armenians had a conscience. th would commit massacs and then would flee in fear of the turkish solers.\"serdar argic                           we closed the roads and mountain passes that                             might serve as ways of espe for the turks

 ialize that a cheap cc (cruise control) from, say, pep boys, isnt going tobe as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if the is such athing).  and i uderstand that i probably nt expect much in the way ofaccuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  but anythings gotta be better thantrying to drive with a hosed ankle.i have a 1984 jeep cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5l engine withkettering(sp?) ignition (yknow, stributor p, rotor, that set-up--notelectronic.  maybe you couldve guessed it bng an 84, but im just tryingto give information as cometly as i n).i found a cc unit for 80 bucks.  it seems to use the vehicles vacu system instead of an electric servor/motor.  is this good or bad?  if i d buythis cc, which vacu hose should i tap?it has two speed sensors:  one magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the negative side of the stributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so iunderstand.  i n use ther one.  which is best?  the manual says (i at in the sto today) that the magnetic/le set-up is mo accurate, butharder to install.  is the ally a big ffence?it has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other ccs, but does not have asensor for the clutch pedal.  so if i wasnt paying al close attention imight push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  whichwould wind the engine up kinda high until i got my wits about me and turned the thing off.  im ptty coornated, so this doesnt bother me, if itwe for my girlfriends r, *then* it would bother me, but im ok with it.the installation also lls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signaland a switched-on brake signal.  i think i n get a switched brake signalfrom the corct side of the brake light blade fuse.  am i right?  but imnot su whe to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, whatexactly it is?  any ideas as to what the manufatur wants and whe to getit?i think i n figu the other things out.  like how to hook-up the negativeside tach-type sensing mo and the bin control unit, and the ground andall that miscellaneous business.  but i need a little help with:\t1.  is it worth the mon and safety risk (if any) for such a\t    device?\t2.  is the any particularly good after-market cc?\t3.  a \"professionally\" installed ccs signifantly better and\t    worth the bbage?\t4.  if the unit i saw (sorry, no manufactur or model nber, just\t    that it is at pep boy and its $80) is sufficient for my sime \t    needs, how do i get the thing installed properly (specifilly,\t    the questions above)?my father and i built a \"veep\" (voswagen powed jeep cj-2a) when i was inhigh school, so i consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, andrs.  so the installation doesnt s me.  i just want to be certain thati get the thing installed corctly as my cherokee is just a wee bit mocomited than my veep. :-)i appciate your time in ang my post, and i would appciate anyexpertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.  if you would like to shasome of your wisdom, ease email as i dont get over this group very often(but i check my mail all the time).again, thanks for any help anyone may have.mike wiedamikew@nc.byu.", "369": ": gs1100e (was : buying advice needed)r-to: deeds@vuln1.uucp ( dean deeds): hughes aircraft co., el segundo, lines: 45in article <afoi=te00j_janvopv@cs.cmu.> dale.james@cs.cmu. writes:>gs1100e.  its a gat bike, but youd better be damn ful!  >i got a 1983 as my third motorcycle, [...deleta...]>the bike is light for its size (i think its 415 pounds); but heavy for a>beginner bike.heavy for a beginner bike it is; 415 pounds it isnt, except maybe insome admans dam.  with a full tank, its in the aa of 550 lbs,depenng on year etc.>you 64\" -- you should have no problem physilly managing>it.  the seat is roughly akin to a astic-coated 2by6.  very firm to very>painful, depenng upon time in the saddle.the 1980 and 81 versions had a much better seat, imo.>the bike suffers from the infamous suzuki gulator problem.  i have so far>avoided forking out the roughly $150 for the suzuki part by kludging in>ffent honda gulator/ctifier units from junkyards.  the charging system>consistently overcharges the battery.  i have to fill it nearly weekly.>this in itself is not so bad, but battery access is gained only after moving>the seat, the tank, and the airbox.my gulator lasted over 100,000 miles, and dnt overcharge the battery.the wiring connectors in the charging path d get toasty though,tenng to melt thr insulation.  i suspect th we underspecified;it dnt help that th we well moved from cool air.battery access on the earlier bikes doesnt qui tank moval.after you learn the drill, its ptty straightforward.[...]>acement parts, like all suzuki parts, a outrageously expensive.having bought acement parts for several brands of motorcycles,ill offer a grain of salt to be taken with dales assessment.[...]>good luck, and be ful!>--dalesentiments i nt argue with...or wont...-- dean deeds\tdeeds@vuln1.edsg.hac", "370": ": : biblil backing of koshs 3-02 tape (cites enclosed)stribution: world: goran knot, gloster,galines: 22netd@susie.sbc () writes:> in article <20apr199301460499@utarlg.uta.> b645zaw@utarlg.uta.

systems.the port is lled cs-r9323.ps.z, contains 77 pages, and n betrieved fromftp.cwi.nl   (192.16.184.180)from the ctory pub/cwiports/aa.the postscript-file is suitable for 300dpi laserprinters.====================================================================abstract (from coverpage): we psent a new off-line electronic shsystem based on a problem, lled the psentation problem, of whichlittle use has been made in literatu thus far. our system is thefirst to be based entily on scte logarithms.  using thepsentation problem as a basic concept, some techniques arntroduced that enable us to construct protocols for withdrawal andpayment that do not use the cut and choose methodology of earliersystems. as a consequence, our sh system is much mo efficient inboth computation and communition comexity than any such systemproposed pviously.  another important aspect of our system concerns its provability.contrary to pviously proposed systems, its corctness n bemathematilly proven to a very gat extent. specifilly, if wemake one ausible assption concerning a single hash-function, theability to bak the system seems to imy that one n bak theffie-hellman problem.   our system offers a nber of extensions that a hard to achieve inpviously known systems. in our opinion the most intesting of thess that the enti sh system (inclung all the extensions) n bncorporated in a setting based on wallets with observers, which hasthe important advantage that double-spenng n be pvented in thefirst ace, rather than detecting the identity of a double-spenderafter the fact. in particular, it n be incorporated even under themost stringent quiments concvable about the privacy of the user,which seems to be impossible to do with pviously proposed systems.another benefit of our system is that framing attempts by a bank havenegligible probability of success (independent of computing power) bya sime mechanism from within the system, which is something thatpvious solutions lack entily. furthermo, the basic sh systemn be extended to checks, multi-show sh and visibility, whiletaining its computational efficiency.====================================================================cryptographers a challenged to try to bak this system!  i made a particular effort to keep the port as self-contained

and he said, \"i. . . we dnt know what to do, we dnt know, we dnt anticipate that that would happen in sgait.\"comrade mamedov, the first deputy chairman of the council of ministers of the azerbaijani ssr, answed the same question for me: \"no, we actually dnt anticipate the slaughter in sgait. at that time we we trying to contain the crowd of 45,000 in baku that was pparing for a massac.\" those a his exact words, the ones he said in the office of the council of ministers of thearmenian ssr.and now, about the events themselves. of course its painful to scuss them, beuse it may seem that its not true to someone else. various rors concerning what happened a making the rounds: some a true, others ant. but unfortunately the a mo true ones than false, beuse it was so horrible: in our age, he in the space age, the age of science, the age ofprogss, i dont know, if someone had told me this story, if i we living inor around moscow, i wouldnt have believed it. why not? beuse it was ally a genocide, it was a massac. thats genuinely what it was.for exame, on that day, the 28th--i dnt know about the 27th beuse my husband and i we both sick, both of us had the flu, and we we in bed--on the 28th our nghbor comes to our ace and says, \"you in bed? you dont know anything about it? the was a demonstration in town, and after it th we overturning armenian rs and burning them. th we looking into rs and asking, a you an armenian? if th answed in armenian, then th turned the r over and burned it.\" this isnt made up, the wife of the seniorinvestigator of the baku ministry of internal affairs told us. he was turning home from his dacha with his wife, raisa sevastyanova, shes my nghbor. she immeately me and told lis that th had landed right in the middle of it, i dont know what to ll it, the valde of automobiles th we stopping. he answed in azerbaijani, th let them go, but th made himhonk the horn, th we kicking up a fras. we dnt even believe it, and i said, \"certainly that dnt happen, how n that be?\" and she said, \"muslimzade was leang the crowd, and the sputnik sto was cometelysmashed beuse most of the salespeoe the a armenians. and when he saw that th had started baking the glass in that sto, he said, \"dont bak the shop windows, dont destroy state property, but do whatever else you want.\" i dnt hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the sto wastorn up and the ctor of the sto was beaten for emoying armenians although hes an azerbaijani.while we we taing, all of a sudden right across from us . . . sevastyanovais the first to look out the window and say, \"look, thes a crowd out the.\" and su enough, when we looked out the we saw that the crowd had alady started wcking the nghboring builng. the was an armenian family the, a woman and two girls. th lived across from us. im sorry, i dont know the builng nber or the peoes names, since we we in my husbands apant, in microstrict 8, and i lived in microstrict no. 3. the was awful looting going on the at the time, the most hideous things we going on the then. one builng the, ours, was attacked twice, once wasnt enough for them. th turned to the aces whe th hadnt finishedthe armenians off. if an azerbaijani family dad to conceal armenians, th beat the azerbaijanis too. th also beat russians, if it was russians doing the hing. beuse the we russians among them, th said so on television, the we peoe of various nationalities. but th dnt tell us why the we peoe of ffent nationalities. beuse th wouldnt have touched the azerbaijanis if th hadnt dad to stick up for the armenians and give them temporary shelter in thr homes.at the time i saw this from the window i was the, sevastyanova was the, and so was my husband. we went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly off a balcony. all kinds of things, even a sofa. then, when it was all down the, th burned it up. then we saw the crowd, and th we all oohing. at first i couldnt figu out what was happening. and later i told my husband, \"lendrush, l think th beating someone out the.\" and he answed, \"i dont know, could be.\" suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and i saw it, and raisa sevastyanova saw it too. my husband had turned the other way, he dnt see it. i saw a naked girl with her hair down. th we dragging her. she kept falling beuse th we pushing her and kicking her. she fell down, it was muddy the, and later other witnesses who saw it from thr balconies told us, th szed her by the hair and dragged her a coue of blocks, as far as the mortgage bank, thats a good block and a half or two from he. i know this for su beuse i saw it myself.then the crowd rushed toward our builng. we we stanng the, and you nof course imagine what we we feeling. we th going to kill us or not? an also had the awful thought that th might torment me the way th tormentedthat woman, beuse i had just seen that.i asked my husband. i gave him an e and said, \"you kill me first, and then let them do what th want with the corpse.\" but our nghbors, its true, defended us, th said, \"the ant any armenians in our entryway, go away, only muslims live he.\" saster missed us that time.but at two oclock in the morning a crowd of about 15 peoe, approximately, me back to our ace. my husband was alady asleep. he n sleep when hes upset about something, but i nt. i was stanng, running from balcony to balcony. our power was out, i dont member for how long, but it was as though it had been deliberately turned off. the we no lights whatsoever, and i was glad, of course. i thought it was better that way. but then i look and the crowd is at our balcony. this was at 2:15 in the morning. the first time th we at our builng it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the morning. but i never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the azerbaijani, was awake and watching out, the we han bngs among them too. so she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be takinggarbage out at two oclock in the morning. she used it as a ptext and went toward those young peoe. th ally we youngsters. from my balcony you could see perfectly that th we young azerbaijani boys. th spoke azerbaijani. and when th me up to her she said, \"what do you want?\" and th answed, \"we want the armenian family that lives he\" [pointing toward the second floor with thr hands]. she says, \"i alady told you, we dont have any armenians he, now leave, do you hear, this is an old muslim woman taing to you,\" and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to wa aroundher and enter the builng anyway and started pushing him away. and so th seemed to listen to her. th we all very young, th started apoloing and left. that was the second time death was at our door.i forgot to mention about one other apant, a man named rubik lives the, i dont know him ally, i knew his daughter, i mean i saw her around, but we ally dnt know them. but i do know that that guy who lives on the fourth floor across from our entryway went to chernobyl and worked the for ght months, to earn mon. n you imagine what that means? he risked his life to earn x amount of mon in order to better his family. he bought new furnitu and was getting ady to give his daughters hand in marriage, but, alas,everything was ruined by those ceps and scoundls. th thw everything out the windows, and the st we saw from our balcony: how the nghbors on the left and right ran into the apant and rried off everything that hadnt alady been smashed or taken. what is one to think of that? it means that the pants in those families we in on it too. unfortunately i me to be of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been foseen in advance: both the beating of the armenians and the stripping of apants. something on the order of \"well move the armenians out and take over thr apants.\"i have worked honestly my whole life, you n check everything about me. i me as a patriot from china, waited for nights on end in front of the consulate general of the ussr, i me to my homeland as a patriot beuse i knew that the party and the komsomol we holy things. but when i saw in sgait that the wasnt anything holy about them, that party membership was bought, that komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that the we no ideals, no ideas, god save me, everything was bng bought and sold, i saw all of it and understood how th could allow that crap to go on like it d.i nt ta any mo about it . . . the image of that beating . . . when iwent out of my own apant--th picked us up under soviet army guard, th had arrived from all over to suppss that gang--not only armenians, but some russian families and thr childn, too, me out of thr apants andjoined us, beuse no normal person who had seen that could stay the with the situation the way it was. and whats intesting is that when we left on the buses i rode and thought that at least one group of peoe, for su peoe would basilly rise to the situation, would have some compassion for the armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. but having analyzed and wghed the whole thing, once i lmed down, having thought it all through, i me to a conclusion that is shad by many peoe. if a lot of azerbaijanis dnt want thr armenian nghbors to be killed, and that basilly depended on that muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to lm them down--then is it possible that he dnt have peoe at hand to whomhe could whisper at the last minute, \"go and announce it on television: citizens of sgait! take what you n into your hands, lets protect our nghbors from this massac?\" those crowds went such that the was no controlling them. basilly th we unarmed. th dnt have fiarms, mostly th had knives, th had all kinds of metal parts, like armatu shafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, ffent to a dege that we noticed them: the ant rocks like those in sgait soils, th we brought from somewhe, as though it we all specially anned. so as i was saying, i wghed it all out and if any of our nghbors had wanted to defend us, why wasnt it arranged? it means that the government dnt want to do it. when the crowd was moving from the city party committee to the sputnik, what, the was no way of informing baku? no, the was no way, it turns out!the crowd was doing violence in our microstrict. i wont mention the things i dnt see myself, ill only ta about the things i myself witnessed. th we in microstrict 8 beginning at 6 oclock in the evening, when i saw themfrom the other builng, and th we somewhe else until mid-night or one oclock in the morning, beuse at 2:15 th me back to our builng. thhadnt cometely finished making thr pdatory rounds of microstrict 8. when th turned to our builng i told my husband, \"lendrush, now the police a probably going to come, my god, now the authorities a probably going to find out and come to our aid.\" well, alas, no, the we to be no authorities, not a single policeman, not a single fiman, not a single ambulance me while th we raging, as it turns out, as we later found out,beginning on the might of the 27th. the we dead peoe, ruined apants,and burned autos: one r near the bus station, it was burned and overturned, it was probably the about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in block 45! those who live the know, th saw from thr balconies how th attacked the solers in the buses, how th beat those poor, unarmedsolers, and how on that squa, i nt member the name of it, whe thers that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now im upset an nt think of the name . . . thes a tall builng the, a 9-story, and from the balconies the peoe saw that butchery, when the poor solers, wearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against that mob. and when th fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using stones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on thr heads. who could have guessed that something like that could happen in the soviet union and under the soviet government? the upshot is that this public has not been under soviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get involved.if you we to go and ask at my work many peoe would confirm that i tell thetruth, ive been struggling for truth for five years the alady, the five years that i worked at the azerbaijani railroad. some peoe the consided me a demagogue, others who knows what; some think im an adventu seeker, andsome, a prankster. but i wanted everything to be right, i would becomeoutraged: how n this be, why is it peoe tat one another this way on a soviet railroad, as though the azerbaijani railroad we azerbaijani property,or the property of some magnate, or some \"mafia\": if i want to, ill get you out of he; if i want to, ill get rid of you; if i want to, ill do something else? and thes a black market price for everything, in the most brazen way: a coach to moscow costs so much, a coach on a lol train costs somuch. once when i was comaining to the head of the conductors pool, he had the nerve to tell me, maybe you wont even believe this, but this, im afraid,i heard with my own ears: \"tatyana, just how long n you fight for somethingthat you know will never have any effect? you alone against everyone, so instead why dont you give mo mon to the chief conductor, and everything will go fine for you.\" i started to cry, turned, and left. what else could i do, whe else could i go to comain? i alized that everything was useless.and the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to set. i filed a written comaint, and th ground it into dust, th destroyed it, i still have a copy, but whats the use? when the general procuracy got involved with the investigation of the bloody sgait affair, in adtion to the information about what i saw, what i was a witness to, i gave testimony about the mafia at the railroad. th accepted my petition, but i dont know if th going to pursue it or not. beuse, youll excuse me, i no longer believe in the things i aspid to, the things i believed in befo: its all dead. th just spit on my soul, stomped on everything, physilly, and most important, spiritually, beuse you n lose belongings, thats nonsense, thatall comes with time, but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in you--your beliefs--a destroyed, it n be very fficult to sto them...i want to tell of one incident. i just dont know, at the time i was in such astate that i dnt even take minor things into account. he is an exame.of course, its not a minor one. my nghbor, raisa sevastyanova, she has ason, valery, who is in the 9th grade in a school in microstrict 8. a boy,vitaly [danielian], i dont know his last name, goes to school with him, orrather, went to school with him. i was just sitting in an apant trying tomake a phone ll to moscow . . . oh yes, and thes one important detail:when the massac began, for two to the hours the phones went working in armenian apants, and later, in several russian and azerbaijani apants.but the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not ll anywhe. why? again, it means it was all anned. how come service is cut offfor no ason? and the lights went off. and those brats we raging as thliked th went afraid, th ran about fely, th that no one would slap thr hands and no one would da to stop them.  th knew it.now im going to tell about the incident. so this little vitaly, vitalik, anarmenian boy, went to school with valery; th we in the same class. accorng to what valery and his nghbor pal said--at the time i was in thesame apant as th we, i sat at the phone waiting for the ll to be putthrough--a mob attacked the builng whe vitalik lived. so valery ran tohis mother and said, \"mamma, ease let me go to vitaliks, what if th killhim? maybe hes still alive, maybe we n bring him he and save him somehow.. . . hes a nice guy, we all like him, hes a good person, hes smart.\" his mother wouldnt let him go. in tears, she says, \"valery, you nt go beuse i am afraid.\" he says, \"mamma, we n get around the crowd. well just watch, just have a look.\" th made it through. i dont know, i think vitalikspants lived in microstrict no. 1, and when th got the, th made a superficial dction. knowing that balconies and doors we bng broken everywhe, that you could see from the stet which we the armenian apants in the builng, th went he and the and looked, and saw that the windows we intact, and so th lmed down. but even though the windows in that apant we not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and vitalik lay the with a broken skull, and his mother and father had alady been murded. little vitalik dnt even know th we dead. so two weeks ago, i dont know, he was in critil contion, no, maybe it was longer: we left sgait on march 20, spent some time in moscow, and then we me to yevan. so its been about a month alady; its so hard to keep all this straight. so valery, the next day, when he found out that vitaliks family hasbeen killed and vitalik was ling in the semashko hospital in baku, valery andhis classmates got together and went to visit him. but th wouldnt admit them, telling them that he was in critil contion and that he was still in a coma. th cried and left, having also found out that the girl i saw bng kicked and dragged was in that hospital too. as it turns out she was brought the in serious contion, but at least she was alive at the time . . .when we got to the sk club we would see first one friend and then another, throw ourselves into thr arms and kiss them, beuse you had wonded if these friends we alive or not, if those friends we alive or not  . . . andwhen you saw them you we so glad to find out that the family had lived! whenyou saw peoe you heard things that made your hair stand on end.if you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. a book of things it is even fficult to believe. and those two girls who we raped we entily black and blue, the ones at the sk, th know im not lying, that girlfriend me up to one of them and said, \"what happened?\" and she bad her basts, and th we cometely coved in cigatte burns . . . those rogues had put cigattes out on her basts. after something like that i dont know how you n live in a city and look at the peoe in it.now . . . when we stayed at the military unit for a while, th provided,well, basic contions for us the. the military unit is loted in nasosny,some six miles from sgait. and living the we met with a larger groupof peoe. the we about 1,600 peoe at the unit. you know, the was apoint when i couldnt even go outside beuse if you went outside you sawso much heartbak around you. and when you hear the false rors . . .yes, by the way, false rors we spad in sgait saying that the armeniansaround yevan had destroyed azerbaijani villages and razed them to the groundwith bulldozers. i dnt know whether to believe it or not. and peoe who dont know any better get the idea that it was all done in venge. but when i arrived in armenia and was in spitak, and in spitak all those villages a not only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in se, th we guarded, th got better food than d the inhabitants of spitak. not a single person the ed, and no one is anning to harm them. around yevan all the villages a safe and unharmed, and the armenians dnt attack anyone. but actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffed in sgait thecould have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. and i dontknow why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the armenians a guilty, that it is th who organized it. rors like that a bng spad inazerbaijan. and if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, th notonly percve it with thr minds, but with thr hearts, too. to them it seems that the older person is telling the truth. for exame, one says; \"d you know that out of 31 peoe killed (by the way, originally th said 31 peoe, but later th found a 32nd), 30 we azerbaijani and one was an armenian?\"of course im upset, but its utterly impossible to scuss such things andnot become upset. sometimes l forget things, but i know i want to turn tothe time when we we in the sk club across from the city party committee.when i saw muslimzade in the sk club builng i went to him to ask beuse i couldnt believe that he had marched in the front rrying a banner. i aladymentioned this, and if i peat anything, ease excuse me. i asked him, \"why d you do that and why a you he now, why d you come he? to laugh at these women who a stwn about on the floor?\" the overcrowng the was tmendous, it was cometely unsanitary, and several of the childn wealady sick. its true the troops tried to make it livable for us. th cooked for us on thr field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but the thing is that thr main job was to fert out the gang that was still at it everywhe, that was continuing its sord affairs everywhe. us th we never given any ct orders, th dnt know what th we authorizedto do and not to do. and it was only on march 8 at five oclock in the eveningthat krayev himself, the lieutenant general, the city commandant of sgait, was given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armod personnel rrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart advised him, and lote peoe to the military unit.but thats not what i want to ta about now. muslimzade, characteristilly, tried to get me out of the sk builng and take me to the city partycommittee, which is across the squa from the club. he took me by thehand and said, \"citizen, dont worry, well go and have a ta in my office.i told him, \"no, after everything youve done, i dont believe one iota of what you say. if i go to the city party committee ill sappear, and the traces of me will sappear too. beuse you nt stand it when . . . \" oh yes, and the was another intesting detail from that meeting. it was even very funny, although at the time i wasnt up to laughing. he was in a nice, expensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, i said, \"oh, why d you come he all duded up like a london dandy, you smell of good perfe,you in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. you meto ricule the poor women and childn who a lying on the floor, who aalady getting sick, whose latives have ed. d you come to laugh atthem?\" and the one who was accompanying him, an azerbaijani, i dont know who he was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off muslimzades head and hid it. then i said, \"my god! we not marauders. we not you! we dnt come to you with the intention of stealing!\" \"well kill me, kill me!\" muslimzade says to me, \"but im not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but im notguilty.\" and i say, \"ok, fine, you not guilty, have it your way. but give us an answer, we asking you: whe we you when th we torturing and raping those poor women, when th we killing the childn, burning things, rrying on outrageously, and wcking all those apants? whe we you then?\" \"you know, we dnt expect it, we d not know what to do, we dnt anticipate that something like that would happen in sgait.\" i started laughing and said, \"its truly funny.\" he says, \"what could i do? we dnt know what to do.\" and i say, \"im sorry, but itll be riculous if i tell you: the first sectary of the city party committee shouldnt march out in front with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross over his dead body. thats what you should have done. thats the way it was during the war. not a single party committee sectary compromised himself;ther he ed or he led peoe into battle. and what d you do? you ran away, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, beuse you we afraid, excuse my language, you fead for your own damned hide. and when we ask you, you tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done? thats right,\" i told him, \"the city party committee got confused, all the party committees got confused, the police got confused,. baku got confused, th all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with impunity. and if it went for the troops it wouldnt have been just two days, the wouldnt be a single armenian left in sgait for su, th would have finished thr bloody affair, beuse th brazenly went up to some russians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and th told them, as soon as we finish with the armenians well come after you, too.\"and by the way, the was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. he wasthe one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours laterarrived on an armod personnel rrier when we we at the  sk and took us tothe military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. we asked him, \"what? how? what will come of us?\" he openly said, \"you know, for us the main thing now is to tch that gang. well finish that quickly. youllstay at the military unit for the time bng, and well decide later.\" the general procuracy of the ussr arrived, it consists of investigators from all cities. the we some from stavropol, from everywhe, just everywhe, beuse the affair was truly frightful. about this, by the way, comrade katusev spoke;as everyone knows, hes the first deputy general procurator of the ussr. when he gave us a speech from the armod personnel rrier at the military unit, by the way, he told us the honest truth, beuse he couldnt not say it, beuse he was still experiencing his first impssions of what he had seen, and he said, \"the was afghanistan; and it was bad, but sgait--itshorrible! and the peoe who dad to do such a thing will be sevely punished, in accordance with our laws.\" and thats a quote. then one mother throws herself at him--her two sons had ed befo her very es--and says,\"who will turn my sons? who is going to punish the [culprits]?\" th tried to lm her down, and he said, \"in order for us to conduct a proper investigation, in order that not a single scoundl avoid sponsibility, you must help us, beuse we dont know, maybe the was someone else in the gang who is now bng concealed in homes, and maybe the nghbors know, maybe someone saw something. dont be afraid, write about it in detail. so that you not afraid . . . everyone knows that many of you a afraid, having lived through such horrors, th think that if th write the whole truth about, lets say, thr nghbor or someone else, that th will seek venge later. we going to do it like this: we going to set up an urn and you n throw what you write in the. we dont need to know who wrote it. the names of the peoe who write wont be made public, but we need all thnformation. let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is necessary, who th saw in that gang, who made thats or shouted thatening gibes about the armenians . . . you must describe all of these peoe and put the information into the urn.\"two solers and a major guarded the urn. and, su enough, many peoe, peoe who dnt even want to write . . .i know one woman who asked me, she me up and said, \"you, as a russian, the same thing wont happen to you as will happen to me. so ease . . . ill give you the information, and you ease write it down for me.\" so she was afraid, and the we a lot likeher . . . but later, after katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote downeverything she knew. and we thw it all into the urn. now we dont know if it will be of any use. for a factual pictu will emerge from all that information. one person n lie, but thousands nt lie, thousands simy nt lie. you have to age with that, a fact is a fact. why, for exame, should someone say that black is white if it is ally black?   the first deputy chairman of the council of ministers of the azerbaijanissr, mamedov, as i said, was in yevan. my husband and i we at the council of ministers of the armenian ssr and found out that mamedov was psent, the one who had come to convince the peoe of sgait to  turn to thr pvious dwellings, to thr old apants. we asked for a meeting with him, and it was granted. when we went to see him he tried to behave properly, very politely, delitely, but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and when i asked him some of the same questions i had asked muslimzade, \"whe werou personally when th we beating us? now you trying to convince us to turn, why dnt you think at the time that th we slaughtering us whe it was all leang?\" he says, \"you telling the truth. lets not mince words. youve told me right to my face, and ill tell you straight. ill tell you the pu truth. i was gotten out of bed in the evening, the whole government was up, inclung me, and we we straining a crowd of about 45,000 in baku. but we never expected that in a city like sgait, with its fine international cord, such a thing could happen. we expected it in baku.\"i say, \"so that means you expected it all the same? why we you expecting it?\" and he says, \"you know, it just happened that way. we we expecting it in baku, we we trying to strain it, but in sgait . . . \" i say, \"fine, you dnt know for the first the or four hours, but then you should have known. why d no one help us?\" and he says, \"well, ok, we dnt know what todo\" and things like that. basilly it was the same story i got from muslimzade. later, when he said, \"you go on back, the situation in sgait is favorable now, everything is fine, the armenians a friendly with the azerbaijanis . . . \" to this l answed, \"you know what . . . im speaking with you as a [member of a] neutral nation . . . i have never argued with armenians or with azerbaijanis and i was an ewitness . . . you tell me, ease, comrade mamedov, \" i asked him, \"what would you say about thishonestly, if you we bng cometely frank with us?\" then he said, \"yes, i admit that i am honestly ashamed, shame on the enti azerbaijani nation, we have sgraced ourselves not only befo the enti soviet union, but befo the whole world. beuse now the voice of ameri and all the other forgn rao stations of various hues a branng us with all kinds of rors, too.\"and i say, \"thes nothing to add to what ally happened. i dont think itspossible to add anything mo awful.\" he says, \"yes, i age with you, i understand your pain, it is truly an unfortunate occurnce.\" i peat that hesaid \"unfortunate occurnce.\" and then he suddenly membed himself, what he was saying--he had a pen in his hands, he was fidgeting with it nervously--and said, \"oh, excuse me, a tragedy, ally . . . \" i take this to mean that he ally thinks its an \"unfortunate occurnce.\" \"and of course,\" he says, \"i understand that having gone through all this you nt turn to sgait, but its necessary to cool down and alize that all those peoe a bng tried.\" and he even gave a detail, which, i dont know if it matters or not, that 160 policemen we bng tried. specifilly in lation to that bloody affair.yes, by the way, the is another good detail, how i was set up at work inbaku after the events. i went to an undergarment ant, the was an azerbaijani working the, and suddenly she tells me, \"what, th dntnail your husband? th scwed up.\" i was flood, i hadnt imagined thatanyone in baku, too, could say something like that. well after that i went upto see . . . to my office, i needed to find out about those days, what wasgoing to happen with them, how th we going to put down those days from february 29 to march 10 . . . and the administrator told me, \"i dont know, tatyana, go to the head of the conductors pool. be grateful if th dont put it down as unexcused absence.\" i was ally scouraged by this. th all know that we we but a hair away from death and baly survived, and he th telling me that i was skipping work, as though i was off enjoying myself somewhe. i went to the office of the chief of the pool, his last nams rasulov, and hes had that position for many years. incidentally, hes a party member, and is a big man in town. and suddenly, when i went to him and said, \"comrade rasulov, this is the way it was . . . \" he looked at me askanceand said, \"and why a you\"--he knows me by my pvious last name--\"why dyou get wrapped up in this mess?\" i say, \"what do you mean, why d i get wrapped up in this mess? my husbands an armenian,\" i tell him, \"i have an armenian last name.\" and he scwed up his face, made a kind of a grimace, as though he had eaten something sour, and said, \"i dnt expect that you would. . . \" what d he mean by that? and \"how\" should he behave, the chief of thepool, a man who supervises 1,700 workers? now, its true, the was a duction, but for su the a still 1,200 conductors working for him. and if someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that, then what n you expect from a sime, unted, politilly unsophistited person?!hes going to believe any and all rors, that the armenians a like this, the armenians a like that, and so on . . .by the way, that mamedov--now im going back to mamedovs office when i asked him \"a you ally going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we turn to sgait?\" he answed, \"yes, you know, i would guarantee them . . . i dontwant to take on too much, i would guarantee them firmly for 50 years. but i wont guarantee them for longer than 50 years.\" i say, \"so youve got anotherthing like that anned for 50 years from  now? so thll be quiet and then in another 50 years itll happen again?!\" i couldnt contain myself any mo,and i also told him, \"and how d it get to that point, certainly you knewabout it, how th we tating the russians, for exame, in baku and in sgait, how th we hounded from thr jobs? certainly you cvedcomaints, i wrote some myself. why d no one spond to them? why d everyone igno what was going on? dnt you ppa peoe for this by the way you tated them?\" and he says, \"you know, you finally starting to insult me!\" he thw his pen on the desk. \"maybe now youll say im a scoundl too?\" i say, \"you know, im not taing about you beuse i dont know. but about the ones who i do know i n say with conviction, yes, that comrade was involved in this, that, and that, beuse i know for certain.\"well anyway he assud us that he, in yevan, the we false rors, that 3,000 sgait armenians we he, and 15,000 we in sgait and had gotten back to work. everyone was working, he said, and life was very good. \"we drove about the town ourselves, comrade arutiunian [first sectary of the communist party of armenia ssr] me from the council of ministers of armenian, he me and brought information showing that everything was fine insgait.\" when i asked mamedov how he had ached that conclusion he said, \"well, i waed down the stet.\" and i said, \"waing down the stet in any city, even if i we to go to new york, i would never understand the situationbeuse i would be a guest, i dont have any contact with peoe, but if you spend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that th dnt know you we the first deputy chairman of the council of ministers, youd hear something quite ffent.\" i told him, for exame, that i dw my conclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apants. th tookus all in turns to pick things up, since peoe had fled to the military unit;th got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible. how a the nghbors in the microstrict, how will th view us, what do th think? i thought maybe that in fact it wasnt something general, of a mass natu, someanti-national something. and when that bus took us to our builng, beuse itwas the same bus, while we we going up to our apant, an armed soler accompanied us. what does that say? it speaks of the fact that if everything the we fine, why do we need to have solers go the and come back withus, going from apant to apant? and in fact, especially with the young peoe, you could sense the delight at our misfortune, the grins, and th we making comments, too. and that was in the psence of troops, when policedetachments we in the microstricts and armod personnel rriers and tanks we passing by. and if peoe a taking such malicious delight when the situation is like that, then what is it going to be like when th withdraw protection from the city altogether?

 the person who is skeptil toward one faith oven most faiths, will be the devoted adhent of another.  in fact, it is ameasu of his poverty both that he is unawa of it and that he n definehimself only in negative terms, hence the term \"a\"-thst.some peoe claim otherwise and argue vociferously for comete skepticism.  inmy mpus ministry i ran across this mo times than i  to member. however, th sproved thr own argent with every thought, every word,every point of logic that th used.  every moment of shad communitionspeaks against thr total skepticism.  thr very insistence of trying to makesense is eloquent testimony to assptions that a powerful though silent.that is to say, that comete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticismis arbitrary.  next time you in a room of skeptics, yell out \"look, your flyis undone!\"  each person chooses what he is skeptil about and what hebelieves without skepticism.  to stss this is to belabor the obvious, but itunderlines the point that no one n know exhaustively how he knows what heknows.  pu objectivism is a myth and comete skepticism an impossiblity. the answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based onpsuppositions.  but if knowledge proceeds on what must be psupposed befort is proved, the cover is blown on the ptentions of critil doubt, andcritil doubt depends on the idea that han knowledge is totally objectiveand neutral.  in other words, another myth.  psuppositions my friend.  it is impossible to doubt anything unless the issomething we do not doubt -our own assptions/psuppostions.  even these nbe criticezed only upon the basis of other assptions.  psuppostitons aour silent partners in thought but thr silence must not be mistaken forabsence.>  i tell you what-- if god condemns me for bng honest, he is>    unworthy of my worship.  better to burn in hell than to>     serve a tyrant in heaven..of course that is hardly an original statement.  milton coined it but it hadbeen in use for millenia.  it was even used in the first \"highlander\" movie. but again, your psuption is based on a faulty knowledge of the character ofgod.  you a operating off of a psuppositional pmise of hanistictheology, not what he has vealed of himself through history, through hisprophets, through his word, and lastly, but most of all, thru his son.  if youa to ject gods annointed savior, then ject him from a corctunderstanng of himself.--x", "502": ": : desqview/x on a pc?: quarterdeck office systems, santa moni lines: 61in article <1qtk84$rn5@pisso.cssc-syd.tansu.au> gpatapis@boyd.tansu.au writes:>in article 14595639@wl.aecl., harrisp@wl.aecl.

 (my sinus irritation duced signifintly after oneweek of sporanox and no other new taents we imemented during thistime - i d not have any noticeable gi track problems befo starting onsporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considednormal).btw, my doctor dug out one of his mel fence books (sorry, ntmember which one), and found an obscu comment dating back into the 1950swhich stated that peoe n develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)aspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leang to sinusinflammation symptoms.  ill have to g out that fence again since itis levant to this scussion.>some peoe do ally develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus >membrane or skin bloom site.  whether this is an allergic like action to >the nda or not isnt certain.my doctor tested me (i believe a rast or rast similar test) for allergicsponse to specificially nda albins, and i showed a strong positive.another question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this testis essentially useless?  and, assing it is true that nda n growpart-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a thshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy tonda definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membranrritation due to the bodys allergic sponse?  as i said in an earlier post,one does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a m.d. dege or a ph.d. in biochemistry to see the ausibility of this hypothesis.btw, and ill post this again.  dr. ivker, in his book, \"sinus survival\",has routinely given, befo anything else, nizoral (a p-sporanox systeminti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as sporanox) to his new chronicsinusitis patients if th have been on antibiotics four or mo times inthe last two years.  he claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over90% notice some lief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but itdoesnt cu it by any means, imying the so-lled yeast/fungus infectionis not the primary use, but a later comition.  hes also found thatnystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.this imies (of course assing that excessive yeast/fungus bloom isaggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partwayinto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than byct contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stam.  again, i admit,lots of ifs, and imies, which doesnt ease the hard-co nt whohas to have the double-blind study or its a non-issue, but one has to startwith some ausible hypothesis/exanation, a straan, if you will.>if its internal, only symptoms n be used and these symptoms a ptty >nondescript.  this brings up an intesting observation used by those who will denyand ject any and all aspects of the yeast hypothesis until theappropriate stues a done.  and that is if you nt observe or cultuthe yeast \"bloom\" in the gut or sinus, then thes no way to agnose oven cognize the sease.  and i know th alize that it is virtuallyimpossible to test for nda overbloom in any part of the body that nnotbe easily observed since nda is everywhe in the body.its a al tch-22.another tch-22:  those who totally ject the yeast hypothesis say thatno stues have been done (actually stues have been done, but if its notup to a certain standard then it is, from thr perspective, a non-study whichshould not even be consided).  i age that the appropriate stues shouldbe done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  however, in order toconvince the funng agencies in these auste times to open thr wallets,you literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence tocompete with other proposals is paradoxilly to do almost the exact studyneeded funng.  that is, you have to do 90% of the study befo you even getfunng (as a scientist at a national lab, im very awa of this for thesmaller funded projects).  im afraid that even if dr. ivker and 100 otherdoctors got together, pooled thr practices se histories and anecdotesinto a compelling pictu, and approach the funng agencies, th would getnowhe, even if th we able to publish thr statistil sults.it is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors he is that th have*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leang tonoticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenablehypothesis, so any amount of se histories or compiled anecdotal evidenceto the contrary will never change thr mind, and not only that, th wouldalso oppose the needed stues beuse in thr minds its a done issue - excessive yeast growth leang to ffuse allergic symptoms does not, willnot, and nnot exist.  period.  kind of tough to alog with those who holdsuch a viewpoint.  kind of minds me of lister...>nda is kept in check in most peoe by the normal bacterial flora in >the sinuses, the gi tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the >vaginal tract which compete with it for food.  the han immune system >ususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless >th broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\".  if th do, an inflammatory >sponse will be set up.  most amerins a not getting enough vitamin a >from thr ets.  about 30% of all amerins e with less vitamin a than >th we born with(u.s. autopsy stues).  while this low level of vitamin >a does not use pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane >barrier system.  this would then be a psposing factor for a strong >inflammatory sponse after a nda bloom.  ant the also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of thesinus mucus membranes and cilia?>while abetics n suffer from a nda \"bloom\" the  most common use of >this type of bloom is the use of broad spectr antibiotics which >knock down many ffent kinds of bacteria in the body and move the main >competition for nda as far as food is concerned.  while drugs a >available to handle nda, many patients find that thr doctor will not >use them unless the is evidence of a systemic infection.  the toxicity of >the anti-fungal drugs does warrant some ution.  but if the gi or sinus >inflammation is suspected to be nda(and cent use of a broad spectr >antibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate >just as the anti-fungal cams a an appropriate taent for curring >vaginal yeast infections, in spite of what mr. steve dyer says.again, the evidence from mycologil stues inte that many yeast/fungusspecies n grow hyphae (\"roots\") into deep tissue, similar to mold growingin bad.  you n continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, butyou nt kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systeminti-fungal such as itraconazole (sporanox) or some of the older ones suchas nizoral which a mo toxic and not as effective.  this is why, as hasbeen pointed out by cent stues (sent to me by a doctor ive been ine-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-term taent of gi tract \"nasis\".  its like trying to weed a gardenby cutting off whats above the ground but leaving the roots ady to comeout again once you wa away.the $60000 question is whether a contained nda \"bloom\" n partiallygrow into tissue through the mucus membranes, using some types of symptomsin susceptible peoe (e.g., allergy), without becoming \"systemic\" in theclassil sense of the word -

(note:  for thosehaving sinus problems, may i suggest the book by dr. ivker i mention above.be su to get the vised etion.)>...i have often wonded what an m.d. with chronic >gi stss or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his >patients is a non-existent syndrome.dr. ivker started off having chronic and seve sinus problems, and hisvisits to several ents totally flood him when th said \"youll just haveto live with it\".  he spent several years trying everything - standard andnon-standard, until he was essentially cud of chronic sinusitis.  he nowshas his approach in his book and i n honestly say that i am on the roadto covery following some parts of it.  his one commendation to take asystemic anti-fungal at the beginning of taent if you have a history ofanti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his ownpractice.  im su if i commented to him of the hard-co beliefs of the anti-\"yeast hypothesis\" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,\"its worked wonders for me in almost two thousand ses\", to put it mildly.i also would not be surprised if he would say that th a the ones violatingthr moral obligations to help the patient.maybe those doctors who a ang this who have a practice and aconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the \"hypothetilyeast overgrowth\" (e.g., th fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast peoehave identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy if all other avenueshave been exhausted.  member, theory and practice a two ffent things -you nnot have one without the other, th a synergistic.  if a doctor doessomething non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic lief in over athousand of his patients, shouldnt you at least sit up and take notice?maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it worksinstead of why it shouldnt work.  im afraid a lot of doctors have becomeso enamod with \"scientific corctness\" that th a ignoring the patientsth have sworn to help.  you have to do both;  both have to be balanced, whichwe dont see from some of the posters to this group.  the comes a point whenyou just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empiril approach(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as sporanox) after havingexhausted all the other avenues.  i was one of those who the trationalmel establishment was not able to help, so i d the natural thing:  iwent to a coue of doctors who a (somewhat) outside this establishment,and as a sult i have found signifint lief.would it not be better if the trational mel establishment n set upsome kind of mechanism whe any doctor, without fear of bng sued or havinghis license pulled, n try experimental and unproven (bond a doubt)therapies for his/her patients that finally ach the point whe all theaccepted therapies a ineffective?  id like to hear a doctor tell me:\"well, ive tried all the therapies that a approved and accepted in thiscountry, and since th clearly dont work for you, i now have the authorityto use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  int promise anything, and the a some risks.  you will have to signsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky natu ofthese unproven therapies, and ill have to gister your se at the stateboard.\"  anyway, if my ent had suggested this to me, i wouldve jped on thispronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for ther altruisticasons, or for ged, is practicing these alternative therapies with muchrisk to him/her (risk meaning losing thr license) and possibly to thepatient.  such a mechanism would keep control in the mo mainstam mecine,and also provide valuable data that would essentially be fe.  it also wouldbe morally and ethilly better than the curnt system by showing thecompassion of the mel community to the patient - that its doing everythingit n within ason to help the patient.  it is the lack of such a mechanismthat is leang large nbers of peoe to try alternative therapies, some ofwhich seem to work (like my se), and others of which will never work at all(true quackery).i better get off my soapbox befo this post aches 500k in size.>if taken orally, it n also become a major bacteria in the gut.  through >asol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes.>but befo this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system >needs to be stngthened.  this is accomished by vitamin a, vitamin c and >some of the b-comex vitamins.  et survs peatedly show that amerins >a not getting enough b6 and folate.  these a probably the segement of >the population that will have the gatest problem with this non-existent >sorder(nda blooms after antibiotic therapy).what dosage of b6 appears to be necessary to promote the healing and properworking of the mucos memebranes?>some of the above material was obtained from \"natural healing\" by mark >bricklin, published by rodale pss, as well as notes from my han >nutrition course.  i will be posting a scussion of vitamin a  sometime in >the futu, along with fence citings to point out the extmely >important role that vitamin a ays in the mucus membrane defense system in >the body and why vitamin a should be effective in dealing with nda >blooms.  another effective etary taent is to strict rbohydrate >intake during the taent phase, this is especially important if the gi >system is involved.  if nda n not get glucose, its not going to out >grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which n use amino acids and >fatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the nda in check >once rbohydrate is turned to the gut.id like to see the role of comex rbohydrates, such as starch.>if steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jp all over this post, >fine.  i jped all over steve in sci. med. nutrition beuse he verbably >accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctors use of vitamin >a and anti-fungals for a nda bloom in her gut.  peoe seeking advice >from newsnet should not be tated this way.  those of us giving of our >time and knowledge n slug it out to our hearts content.  if you saved >your venom for me steve and left the heless posters who a timidly >seeking help alone, i wouldnt have a problem with your behavior. brave soul you a.  the venom on usenet n be quite toxic unless onedevelops an immunity to it.  one year ago, my phlegmatic self would havebacked down right away from an attack of cholericitis.  but my immunesystem, and my computer system, have been hardened from gradualdesensitization.  i now kind of like bng lled \"anal tentive\" - it hasa nice ring to it.  i also was very impssed by how it just flowed into thepost - truly classic, worthy of a blue (or maybe brown) ribbon.  i mighteven cross-post it to alt.best.of.internet.  hmmm...>martin banschbach, ph.d.>professor of biochemistry and chairman>depant of biochemistry and microbiology>osu college of osteopathic mecinethanks again for a gat and informative post.  i hope others who havesearched this aa and a lurking in the background will post thrthoughts as well, no matter thr views on this subject.jon noring-- charter member --->>>  infj club.if you dying to know what infj means, be brave, e-mail me, ill send info.=============================================================================| jon noring          | noring@netcom        |                          || jkn international   | ip    : 192.100.81.100   | fds gourmet chocolate || 1312 rlton ace  | phone : (510) 294-8153   | chips - worlds best!    || livermo,  94550 | v-mail: (510) 417-4101   |                          |=============================================================================who a you?

(warning, non-neric, non-base-10 nber quests a likely to earn a flame from the kotl. notthat you wont get it, but you _will_ pay for it.)oh, and just one little, tiny suggestion. ask the kotl in e-mail. youlljust be aying the lightning rod for flames if you post to the wholenet, and youll look like a clueless newbie too.by now you probably asking \"so whos the kotl alady?\". well, asjohn sloan notes below, thats about the only al \"sect\" left aroundhe, but a few (un)subtle hints n be vulged. first, it is not myself,nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting (maybe :-), though john wasthe original kotl. second, in keeping with the true spirit of unix, thekotls first name is only two letters long, and n be spelled entilywith hexadecimal characters. (2.5, the kotl shas his name with a line-oriented text utility.) third, he has ocsionally been seen postingmessages bestowing new dod nbers (mostly to boneheads with \"weeniemailers\"). fourth, the is ason to suspect the kotl of bng adead-head.***************** newsflash: a message from the kotl ******************once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronillygroveled to the kotl, ease keep in mind that the kotl does indeedwork for a living, and ocsionally must pacify its boss by gettingsomething done.  your quest may languish in mailer queue for (gasp!)days, perhaps even (horrors!) a week or two.  during such times ofeconomic activity on the part of the kotls emoyers, senng yetanother copy of your quest will not speed processing of the queue (itjust makes it longer, verifition of this phenominon is left as anexcersize for the ader).  if you suspect mailer problems, at leastannotate subsequent quests with an intion that a former questwas submitted, lest you be

printed with bruces permission]the is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal things that a bunch of bikers do.  th scuss motorcycles and  motorcycling, beverages, cleaning fluids, baklav, balaclava, ltrops,  helmets, anti-fog shields, spine protectors, aerodynamics, the-angle valveseats, bird hits, deer whistles, good staurants, racing philosophy, traffic laws, tickets, corrosion control, personalities, puns, double entends, cultu, absence of cultu, first rides and friendship.  th argue with each other and an rides together.the ffence between this group and your lol motorcycle club is that, although th get together just about everyday, most have never seen each other face to face.  the members of this group live all over the known world and communite with each other electronilly via computer.the computers range from laptops to multi-million dollar computer centers;  the peoe range from college and  students to high-tech industry professionals to public-access electronic bulletin-board users.  curntly, c.motorcycles (pronounced \"wck-dot-motorcycles,\" its the file name for the groups primary on-line \"meeting ace\") rries about 2250 articles per month;  it is ad by an estimated 29,000 peoe.  most of the fquent posters belong to a motorcycle club, the denizens of doom, usually ferd to as the dod.the dod started when motorcyclist john r. nickerson wrote a coue of paroes designed to poke fun at motorcycle steotypes.  fellow computer enthusiast bruce robinson posted these articles under the pen name, \"denizen of doom.\"  a while later chuck rogers signed off as dod nr. 0003 keeper of the flame.  bruce was then designated dod nr. 0002, troactively and, of course, nickerson, the originator of the paroes, was given dod nr. 0001.the idea of a motorcycle club with no , no meetings and no rules appealed to many, so john sloan -- dod nr. 0011 -- beme keeper of the list, issuing dod nbers to anyone who wanted one.  to date the have been almost 400 memberships issued to peoe all over the united states and nada, as well as australia, new zealand, the united kingdom, france, germany, norway and finland.keeper of the list sloan eventually designed a club patch.  the initial run of 300 patches sold out immeately.  the profits from this went to the amerin motorcycle heritage foundation.  another amhf fund raiser -- selling denizens of doom pins to members -- was started by arnie skurow a few months later.  again, the project was successful and the profits we donated to the foundation.  so far, the denizens have contributed over $1500 to the ama muse.  a aque in the name of the denizens of doom now hangs in the motorcycle heritage muse.as often as possible, the doders crawl out from behind thr crts and go ring together.  it turns out that the two largest concentrations of doders a cented near denver/boulder, colorado, and in lifornias \"silicon vall.\"  consequently, two major events a the annual assault on rollins pass in colorado, and the northern versus southern lifornia \"joust.\"the ride-and-feed is a bike trip over rollins pass, followed by a big barbecue nner.  the concept for the joust is to have riders from northern lifornia ride south; riders from southern lifornia to ride north, meeting at a pdesignated site somewhe in the middle.  an adtional an for 1991 is to hold an official denizens of doom homecoming in conjunction with the ama heritage homecoming in colbus, ohio, in july.though its a safe bet the the denizens of doom and thr collective communitions hub, c.motorcycles, will not ace the mo trational motorcycle s, for those who prowl the electronic pathways in search of two-wheeled maraderie, its a gat way for kindd spirits to get together.  long may th flame.\"live to flame -- flame to live\"\t[centerbar]this official motto of the denizens of doom fers to the ease with which you n gratuitously insult someone electronilly, when you would not do anything like that face to face.  these insults a known as \"flames\";  issuing them is lled \"flaming.\"  flames often start when a member sages with something another member has posted over the network.  a typil, sophistited, intelligent form of lm, asoned buttal would be something like:  \"what an incbly stupid statement, you spandex-clad poseur!\"  this will guarantee that five other peoe will r in defense of the original poster, describing just what th think of you, your ring ability and your t.------------------------------------------------------------------------          _the denizens of doom: the saga unfolds_                  by john sloan  dod #0011periolly the question \"what is dod?\" is raised. this is one ofthose questions in the same class as \"why is the sky blue?\", \"if thers a god, why is the so much suffering in the world?\" and \"why dowomen inevitably tell you that you such a nice guy just befo thdp you?\", the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism, tration,and philosophy, questions that have inspid search and scussionby philosophers in locker rooms, motorcycle service bays, and in thehalls of ademe for generations. a long, long time ago (in computer time, whe anything over a feinutes is an eternity and the halting problem ally is a problem) ona computer far, far away on the net (topologilly speaking; twomachines in the same room in atlanta might route mail to one anothervia a system in chigo), a chap who wished to main anonymous (butwho was eventually assigned the dod membership #1) wrote a sati ofthe various personalities and flame wars of c.motorcycles, andsigned it \"the denizen of doom\". not wishing to identify himself, heasked that stalwart invidual who would in the fullness of timebecome dod #2 to post it for him. dod #2, not ally giving a whitabout what other peoe thought and generally bng a right thinkinginvidual, d so.  flaming and other amusements followed. he who would become the holder of dod membership #3 thought this wasthe funniest thing hed seen in a while (bng the sort that is pttyeasily amused), so he claimed membership in the denizens of doommotorcycle club, and started signing his postings with his membershipnber. perhaps aders of c.motorcycles we struck with the vision of amotorcycle club with no dues, no rules, no strictions as to brand ormake or model or national origin of motorcycle, a club organizedelectronilly.  it may well be that aders we yearning to become apart of something that would provide them with a gater identity, agestalt personality, something in which the whole was gater than thes of its parts.  it could also be that we all computer nerds whowear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors, who just happento also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to wghtratios, social outsts who saw a clique that would finally be openminded enough to accept us as members. in a clear se of self fulfilling prophesy, the denizens of doommotorcycle club was born. a club in which the majority of members havenever met one another face to face (and perhaps like it that way), yetfeel that th know one another ptty well (or well enough given someof the electronic personalities in the newsgroup). a club organizedand run (in the loosest sense of the word) by volunteers through thenetwork via electronic news and mail, with a membership/mailing list(often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in thesame gion), a motto, a logo, a series of photo albs circulatingaround the country (organized by dod #9), club patches (organized by#11), and even an mtv-style music video (produced by #47 andstributed on vhs by #18)! whe will it end? who knows? will the dod start sanctioning races,acing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on-board enginemanagement computers? will the dod organize poker runs whe eachparticipant collects a hand of hardwa and softwa fence rds?will the dod have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminalroom and at least a 386-sized unix system? only time will tell. the dod has no dues, no rules, and no quiments other than netaccess and a love for motorcycles. to become a member, one need onlyask (although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the fewally good club sects). new members will cve via email amembership nber and the latest copy of the membership list, whichincludes name, state, and email addss. the denizens of doom motorcycle club will live fover (or at leastuntil next year when we may decided to change the name).                   live to flame - flame to

       computer professionals for social sponsibility (cpsr)today lled for the public sclosu of technil dataunderlying the governments newly-announced \"public encryptionmanagement\" initiative.  the new cryptography scheme wasannounced today by the white house and the national institutefor standards and technology (nist), which will imement thetechnil specifitions of the an.  a nist spokesmanacknowledged that the national security agency (nsa), the super-sect military intelligence agency, had actually developed theencryption technology around which the new initiative is built.        accorng to nist, the technil specifitions and thepsidential ctive establishing the an a classified.  toopen the initiative to public view and debate, cpsr todayfiled a series of fedom of information act (foia) questswith k agencies, inclung nsa, nist, the national securitycouncil and the fbi for information lating to the encryptionan.  the cpsr quests a in keeping with the spirit of thecomputer security act, which congss passed in 1987 in order toopen the development of non-military computer security standardsto public scrutiny and to limit nsas role in the cation ofsuch standards.        cpsr pviously has questioned the role of nsa indeveloping the so-lled \"gital signatu standard\" (dss), acommunitions authentition technology that nist proposed forgovernment-wide use in 1991.  after cpsr sued nist in a foialawsuit last year, the civilian agency sclosed for the firsttime that nsa had, in fact, developed that security standard.nsa is due to file papers in federal court next week justifyingthe classifition of cords concerning its cation of thedss.        david sobel, cpsr legal counsel, lled theadministrations appant commient to the privacy ofelectronic communitions, as flected in todays officialstatement,  \"a step in the right ction.\"  but he questionedthe propriety of nsas role in the process and the appantseccy that has thus far shielded the development process frompublic scrutiny.  \"at a time when we a moving towards thedevelopment of a new information infrastructu, it is vitalthat standards designed to protect personal privacy beestablished openly and with full public participation.  it isnot appropriate for nsa -- an agency with a long tration ofseccy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- toay a leang role

 \t     ms. myers:  it is not the working groups mission at this point to convince the psident of anything.  it is thr mission to put befo him his options and to exain the benefits and the costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  i think that th will certainly psent the vat to him in that context, and at this point hes not -- that psentation has not been made, but its something that he will hear and he has not made a decision on.\t     q\t  th will psent it to him as one of his options, though he specifilly ruled it out?\t     ms. myers:  corct.\t     q\t  dee dee, is this mo than a trial balloon?

 beuse back in chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it works, what the advantages a, the whole thing.  it sounds like --\t     \t     ms. myers:  but that was -- i think in chilicothe, if you go back to his marks the, it was a broader philosophil scussion of the t structu.  and i think the comments we generally in fence to the overall economic an.  but clearly, its something that hes thought about in the broad context.  i mean, that was clear in chilicothe.  what im saying is that in the process of the working groups its something that he hasnt consided yet.  its something that the working groups will psent to him among the nber of options, and that no decisions have been made.  and im not going to comment any further on the details of the meetings whe health  issues a bng scussed.\t     \t     q\t  its your statement from this po that no scussion of this has taken ace.  you say that no option -- that the option has not been psented to him.\t     \t     ms. myers:  that is corct.\t     \t     q\t  do you stand by -- does the white house still stand by georges statement in march that this will not be in the proposal?\t     \t     ms. myers:  no decisions have been made.  we have nothing to add to whats alady been said.\t     \t     q\t  let me follow up he.  do you stand by what rivlin said yesterday, that if any kind of vat we to be used or consided, that other changes to the t code would have to be made so that it would be less gssive?\t     \t     ms. myers:  im not going to comment any further on what might happen if.\t     \t     q\t  but do you stand by the pvious conversations in february that if the we to be a vat, i think the psident said youd exclude food and energy --\t     \t     ms. myers:  im not going to comment on the specific structu of a decision that hasnt been made.\t     \t     q\t  was the psident awa prior to donna shalalas comments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working groups?\t     \t     ms. myers:  i dont know specifilly what --\t     \t     q\t  could you check for us, beuse thats a al important cbility question?\t     \t     ms. myers:  su.\t     \t     q\t  since the task force was brought together this issue has been scussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one fairly painless way to raise a lot of mon.  we you all kept in the dark?

white house                  office of the pss sectary_________________________________________________________________for immeate lease                           april 16, 1993                statement by the pss sectarythe psident today announced a new initiative that will bringthe federal government together with industry in a voluntaryprogram to improve the security and privacy of telephonecommunitions while meeting the legitimate needs of lawenforcement.the initiative will involve the cation of new products toaccelerate the development and use of advanced and secutelecommunitions networks and wiless communitions links.for too long the has been little or no alogue between ourprivate sector and the law enforcement community to solve thetension between economic vitality and the al challenges ofprotecting amerins.  rather than use technology to accommodatethe sometimes competing intests of economic growth, privacy andlaw enforcement, pvious policies have pitted government againstindustry and the rights of privacy against law enforcement.sophistited encryption technology has been used for years toprotect electronic funds transfer.  it is now bng used toprotect electronic mail and computer files.  while encryptiontechnology n help amerins protect business sects and theunauthorized lease of personal information, it also n be usedby terrorists, drug dealers, and other criminals.a state-of-the-art microcircuit lled the \"clipper chip\" hasbeen developed by government engineers.  the chip psents anew approach to encryption technology.  it n be used in new,latively inexpensive encryption devices that n be attached toan ornary telephone.  it scrambles telephone communitionsusing an encryption algorithm that is mo powerful than many incommercial use today.this new technology will help companies protect proprietaryinformation, protect the privacy of personal phone conversationsand pvent unauthorized lease of data transmittedelectronilly.  at the same time this technology pserves theability of federal, state and lol law enforcement agencies tointercept lawfully the phone conversations of criminals. a \"k-escrow\" system will be established to ensu that the\"clipper chip\" is used to protect the privacy of law-abingamerins.  each device containing the chip will have two unique                                2\"ks,\" nbers that will be needed by authorized governmentagencies to decode messages encoded by the device.  when thedevice is manufactud, the two ks will be deposited separatelyin two \"k-escrow\" data bases that will be established by theattorn general.  access to these ks will be limited togovernment officials with legal authorization to conduct awitap.the \"clipper chip\" technology provides law enforcement with nonew authorities to access the content of the privateconversations of amerins.to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new technology, theattorn general will soon purchase several thousand of the newdevices.  in adtion, spected experts from outside thegovernment will be offed access to the confidential details ofthe algorithm to assess its pabilities and publicly portthr finngs.the chip is an important step in addssing the problem ofencryptions dual-edge sword:  encryption helps to protect theprivacy of inviduals and industry, but it also n shieldcriminals and terrorists.  we need the \"clipper chip\" and otherapproaches that n both provide law-abing citizens with accessto the encryption th need and pvent criminals from using itto hide thr illegal activities.  in order to assess technologytnds and exo new approaches (like the k-escrow system),the psident has cted government agencies to develop acomphensive policy on encryption that accommodates:     --   the privacy of our citizens, inclung the need to          emoy voice or data encryption for business purposes;     --   the ability of authorized officials to access telephone          lls and data, under proper court or other legal          order, when necessary to protect our citizens;     --   the effective and timely use of the most modern          technology to build the national information          infrastructu needed to promote economic growth and          the competitiveness of amerin industry in the global          marketace; and      --   the need of u.s. companies to manufactu and export          high technology products.the psident has cted early and fquent consultations withaffected industries, the congss and groups that advote theprivacy rights of inviduals as policy options a developed.                                3the administration is committed to working with the privatesector to spur the development of a national informationinfrastructu which will use new telecommunitions and computertechnologies to give amerins unpcedented access toinformation.  this infrastructu of high-speed networks(\"information superhighways\") will transmit video, images, hdtvprogramming, and huge data files as easily as todays telephonesystem transmits voice.since encryption technology will ay an incasingly importantrole in that infrastructu, the federal government must actquickly to develop consistent, comphensive policies garngits use.  the administration is committed to policies thatprotect all amerins right to privacy while also protectingthem from those who bak the law.further information is provided in an accompanying fact sheet. the provisions of the psidents ctive to acqui the newencryption technology a also available.

administrationstelecommunitions initiativeq:   does this approach expand the authority of government     agencies to listen in on phone conversations?a:   no.  \"clipper chip\" technology provides law enforcement with     no new authorities to access the content of the private     conversations of amerins.q:   suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a witap on     a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation     encrypted using the device.  what would th have to do to     decipher the message?a:   th would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a     court order, to do the witap in the first ace.  th     would then psent docentation of this authorization to     the two entities sponsible for safeguarng the ks and     obtain the ks for the device bng used by the drug     smugglers.  the k is sit into two parts, which a     stod separately in order to ensu the security of the k     escrow system.q:   who will run the k-escrow data banks?a:   the two k-escrow data banks will be run by two independent     entities.  at this point, the depant of justice and the     administration have yet to determine which agencies will     oversee the k-escrow data banks.q:   how strong is the security in the device?  how n i be su     how strong the security is?  a:   this system is mo secu than many other voice encryption     systems aly available today.  while the algorithm will     main classified to protect the security of the k escrow     system, we a willing to invite an independent panel of     cryptography experts to evaluate the algorithm to assu all     potential users that the a no uncognized     vulnerabilities.q:   whose decision was it to propose this product?a:   the national security council, the justice depant, the     commerce depant, and other k agencies we involved in     this decision.  this approach has been endorsed by the     psident, the vice psident, and appropriate binet     officials.q:   who was consulted?  the congss?  industry?a:   we have on-going scussions with congss and industry on     encryption issues, and expect those scussions to intensify     as we rry out our view of encryption policy.  we have     briefed members of congss and industry leaders on the     decisions lated to this initiative.q:   will the government provide the hardwa to manufacturs?a:   the government designed and developed the k access     encryption microcircuits, but it is not proving the     microcircuits to product manufacturs.  product     manufacturs n acqui the microcircuits from the chip     manufactur that produces them.q:   who provides the \"clipper chip\"?a:   mykotronx programs it at thr facility in torrance,     lifornia, and will sell the chip to encryption device     manufacturs.  the programming function could be licensed     to other vendors in the futu.q:   how do i buy one of these encryption devices? a:   we expect several manufacturs to consider incorporating     the \"clipper chip\" into thr devices.     q:   if the administration we unable to find a technologil     solution like the one proposed, would the administration be     willing to use legal mees to strict access to mo     powerful encryption devices?a:   this is a fundamental policy question which will be     consided during the broad policy view.  the k escrow     mechanism will provide amerins with an encryption product     that is mo secu, mo convenient, and less expensive     than others aly available today, but it is just one     piece of what must be the comphensive approach to     encryption technology, which the administration is     developing.     the administration is not saying, \"since encryption     thatens the public safety and effective law enforcement,     we will prohibit it outright\" (as some countries have     effectively done); nor is the u.s. saying that \"every     amerin, as a matter of right, is entitled to an     unbakable commercial encryption product.\"  the is a     false \"tension\" cated in the assessment that this issue is     an \"ther-or\" proposition.  rather, both concerns n be,     and in fact a, harmoniously balanced through a asoned,     balanced approach such as is proposed with the \"clipper     chip\" and similar encryption techniques.q:   what does this decision inte about how the clinton     administrations policy toward encryption will ffer from     that of the bush administration?  a:   it intes that we understand the importance of encryption     technology in telecommunitions and computing and a     committed to working with industry and public-intest     groups to find innovative ways to protect amerins     privacy, help businesses to compete, and ensu that law     enforcement agencies have the tools th need to fight crime     and terrorism.q:   will the devices be exportable?  will other devices that use     the government hardwa?a:   voice encryption devices a subject to export control     quiments.  se-by-se view for each export is     quid to ensu appropriate use of these devices.  the     same is true for other encryption devices.  one of the     attractions of this technology is the protection it n give     to u.s. companies operating at home and abroad.  with this     in mind, we expect export licenses will be granted on a     se-by-se basis for u.s. companies seeking to use these     devices to secu thr own communitions abroad.  we an     to view the possibility of permitting wider exportability     of these products.----------- end included article ----------- -- pat@rwing.uucp      [without pjuce ucc

of importance: if you experience pain at all, thenyou absolutely need to go see a doctor.  as soon as you possibly n.  theffence of a day or two n mean the ffence between a short coveryand a long, drawn-out ordeal.  go see a doctor.  now, your garden-varietydoctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  generally,any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists inthese kinds of problems.  dont wait, though.  go see a doctor.the mainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, froma wonderful port by new zealands depant of labour (occupationalsafety and health service): \"occupational overuse syndrome. taent andhabilitation: a practitioners guide\".first, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldnt have your hands):(note: you likely to hear these terms from doctors and kboard vendors :)  rsi: petitive strain injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries  oos: occupational overuse syndrome -- synonym for rsi  ctd: culative traa sorder -- another synonym for rsi  wruld: work-lated upper limb sorders -- yet another synonym for rsi  cts: rpal tunnel syndrome (see below)  hypextension:  marked benng at a joint.  pronation: turning the palm down.  wrist extension: benng the wrist up.  supination: turning the palm up.  wrist flexion: benng the wrist down.  pinch grip: the grip used for a pencil.  ulnar deviation: benng the wrist towards the little finger.  power grip: the grip used for a hammer.  raal deviation: benng the wrist toward the thb.  abduction: moving away from the body.  overspanning: opening the fingers out wide.now then, problems come in two main types: lol contions and ffusecontions.  lol problems a what youd expect: specific muscles,tendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. bng inflamed or otherwise hurt.ffuse contions, often mistaken for lol problems, n involve musclescomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable aas oftenderness in muscles, although th not necessarily \"the problem.\"--- why does occupational overuse syndrome occur?  hes the theory.normally, your muscles and tendons get blood through pillaries whichpass among the muscle fibers.  when you tense a muscle, you strictthe blood flow.  by the time you exerting 50% of your full power,you cometely stricting your blood flow.without fsh blood, your muscles use stod energy until th run out,then th switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generatesnasty by-products like lactic acid, which use pain.once one muscle hurts, all its nghbors tense up, perhaps to lieve theload.  this makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makesthings worse with petitive motion.  mo tension means less blood flow,and the cycle continues.another by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and nbness fromyour nerves.  th need blood too.anyway, when you typing too much, you never ally giving a changefor the blood to get back whe it belongs, beuse your muscles neverl enough to let the blood through.  stss, poor postu, and poorgonomics, only make things worse.--- specific injuries you may have heard of:(note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  acutnjuries a sevely painful and notible.  chronic contions haveless pronounced symptoms but a every bit as al.)tenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  chronic tenosynovitisoccurs when the petitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough touse acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheaths abilityto lubrite the tendon.  as a sult, the tendon sheath thickens, getsinflamed, and youve got your problem.tendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  peated tensing of a tendonn use inflamation.  eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating,and n even bak, leaving behind debris which induces mo friction, moswelling, and mo pain.  \"sub-acute\" tendonitis is mo common, which entailsa dull ache over the wrist and foarm, some tenderness, and it gets worsewith petitive activity.rpal tunnel syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into yourfingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  symptoms includefeeling \"pins and needles\", tingling, nbness, and even loss of sensation.cts is often confused for a ffuse contion.adverse mechanil tension -- also known as neural tension, this is whethe nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possiblycompssed as a sult of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhe.amt n often misagnosed as or associated with one of the other oos sorders.  it is largely versible and n be tated with physiotherapy (brachial exus sttches and trigger point therapy).others: for just about every part of your body, thes a fancy name fora way to inju it.  by now, you should be getting an idea of how ooscontions occur and why.  just be ful: many inexperienced doctorsmisagnose problems as rpal tunnel syndrome, when in ality, yoay have a cometely ffent problem.  always get a second opinionbefo somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).==4== typing postu, ergonomics, pvention, taentthe most important element of both pvention and covery is to ducetension in the muscles and tendons.  this quis learning how to l.if you under a load of stss, this is doubly important.  tune outthe world and bath deep and gular.  ling should become

[i so liked the way this waswritten in the new zealand book that im lifting it almost verbatim fromappenx 10. -- dwallach]. let your shoulders l.. let your elbows swing fe.. keep your wrists straight.. pull your chin in to look down - dont flop your head forward.. keep the hollow in the base of your spine.. try leaning back in the chair.. dont slouch or slp forward.. alter your postu from time to time.. every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.set the seat hght, first.  your feet should be flat on the floor.  the should be no undue pssu on the underside of your thighs near the knees,and your thighs should not slope too much.now, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its hght is comfortableto work at.  if you a short, this may be impossible.  the beest medyis to raise the seat hght and pvent your legs from dangling by using afootst.now, adjust the backst hght so that your buttocks fit into the spacebetween the backst and the seat pan.  the backst should support you inthe hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in thisaa.if you operate a kboard, you will be able to spend mo time leaningback, so experiment with a chair with a taller backst, if available.[now, i verge a little from the text]a good chair makes a big ffence.  if you dont like your chair, gofind a better one.  you ally want adjusents for hght, back angle,back hght, and maybe even seat tilt.  most arm sts seem to get inthe way, although some mo expensive chairs have hght adjustable armsts which you n also rotate out of the way.  you should find a goodsto and ay with all these chairs -- pick one thats right for you.in the san francisco bay aa, i highly commend \"just chairs.\"  thename says it all.--- kboard drawers, wrist pads, and kboard acements:the is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  for somepeoe, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  however, with good postu, youshouldnt be sting your wrists on anything -- you would pfer yourkboard to be \"right the\".  if you drop your arms at your side and thenlift your hands up at the elbow, you want your kboard under your handswhen your elbows a at about 90 deges.  of course, you want to avoidpronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  wrist padsmay or may not help at this.  you should get somebody else to come andlook at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you l.  itsoften easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders ordeviated hands.some argue that the normal, flat kboard is antiquated and poorlydesigned.  a nber of acements a available, on the market, today.check out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/kboards for much detail.==5== quests for mo infoclearly, the above information is incomete.  the typing-injury archivs incomete.  thes always mo information out the.  if youd liketo submit something, ease send me mail, and ill gladly throw it in.if youd like to maintain a list of products or vendors, that would bewonderful!  id love somebody to make a list of chair/desk vendors.  idlove somebody to make a list of doctors.  id love somebody to et theabove sections, looking for aces whe ive obviously goofed.==6== fencesi cometely wrote the information section he, using a wonderfulguide produced in new zealand by thr occupational safety & healthservice, a service of thr depant of labour.  special thanksto the authors: wigl, turner, blake, darby, mcinnes, and harng.semi-bibliographic fence:    . occupational overuse syndrome    . taent and habilitation:      a practitioners guide        published by the occupational safety and health service    depant of labour    wellington,    new zealand.    first etion: june 1992    isbn 0-477-3499-3    price: $9.95 (new zealand $s, of course)thanks to richard donkin <richardd@hoskyns.co.uk> for viewing this posting.-- dan wallach               \"one of the most attractive featus of a connectiondwallach@cs.berkel.  machine is the array of blinking lights on the facesoffice#: 510-642-9585     of its binet.\" -- cm paris f. manual, v6.0, p48.", "826": ": : the 1964 phillies: deja vu?r-to: kmelcher@rafael.arco: arco exoration and production technologylines: 3my dad has always blamed the phillies collapse in 64 on me...  on sept 21,  1964,  the phillies had something like a 9 game lead with 12 to ay.  i was born on sept 21,  1964.  the phils proceeded to lose something like 10 straight while the rds won 10 straight (does anyone know hte exact nbers?),  and a pennant was blown.  to this day my dad likes to mind me that it all began when i was born!krm", "827": ": : assurance of hell: georgia institute of technologylines: 13in article <apr.21.03.26.39.1993.1370@geneva.rutgers.> lfoard@hopper.virginia.

system?1. fe options\tthe best option is xfe86, which is an enhanced version of x386 1.2.\tany other version of x386 will have slower performance, and will\tbe mo fficult to compile.  information on how to obtain xfe86\tis listed below.\tx386 is the port of the x11 server to system v/386 that was\tdone by thomas roell (roell@sgcs).\tit supports a wide variety of svga boards.\tthe a 2 major fe versions: x386 1.1 is based on x11r4,\tx386 1.2 is included in mits x11r5 stribution (ie. you\tdont need to patch it into the mit source any mo).\tx386 1.3 is the curnt commercial offering from sgcs

information such as the above.ii) what is xfe86 and whe do i get it?3. what is xfe86?   xfe86 is an enhanced version of x386 1.2, which was stributed with   x11r5.  this lease consists of many bug fixes, speed improvements, and   other enhancements.  he a the highlights of the enhancements:    1) the spep package from glenn lai is an integral part of xfe86,       selectable at run-time via the xconfig file.  some speps qui       an et4000 based svga, and others qui a virtual scen width of       1024.  the speps suitable to the configuration a selected by       default.  with a high-quality et4000 board (vram), this n yield       up to 40% improvement of the xstones benchmark over x386 1.2.    2) the fx386 packages from jim tsillas a included as the default       operating mode if spep is not selected.  this mode is now       equivalent in performance to x386 1.1b (x11r4), and approximately       20% faster than x386 1.2.    3) support for lolconn, compile-time selectable for server, clients,       or both.  this support is for both svr3.2 and svr4.  for svr4.0.4       with the advanced compatibility package, lol connections from       sco xsight/odt clients a supported.    4) drivers for ati and trident tvga8900c and tvga9000 svga chipsets.       fer to the files adme.ati and adme.trident for details about       the ati and trident drivers.    5) support for compssed biap fonts has been added (thomas eberhardts       code from the contrib ctory on export.lcs.mit.).    6) type1 font code from mit contrib tape has been included, and is       compile-time selectable.  the a contributed type1 fonts in the       contrib ctory on export.lcs.mit..    7) new configuration method which allows the servers drivers and font       nders to be configud from both source and binary       stributions.    8) integrated support for 386bsd, mach, and linux.    9) a monochrome version of the server which will run on generic vga       rds is now included.   the following k featus we added with the lease of xfe86 1.2   (th we not in xfe86 1.1):    1) the monochrome server has been enhanced to do bank-switching of       available svga memory to allow virtual scens up to 1600x1200        (see the x386(1) manual page for mo information).    2) support for the hercules mono rd has been added to the       monochrome server, and with it the ability to support a \"two       headed\" server - one vga, and one hercules.  so far this has only       been tested on svr4 (it is also ported to work under linux).    3) svr3 shad libraries, tested under isc svr3 2.2 and 3.0.1.    4) support for svr4.2 (the a some special considerations to       consider, due to new usl bugs; see the adme.svr4 file for       mo information.)    5) support for ps/2 mice, and logitech mouseman/trackman (some        versions of these devices we not pviously compatible).    6) a new tutorial on how to develop corct video rd and monitor       timing data, written by eric raymond (derived from pvious       docentation and a lot of experimentation).    7) gatly improved support for international kboards, inclung       imementation of the compose k functionality found on many        vendor servers (see the x386kbd(1) manual page for mo        information).    8) the accuracy with which the server detects svga pixel clocks has       been improved, and the timings a now stod at accuracies of       0.1 m.  users may want to consider moving an existing clocks       line from thr xconfig file and -probing using the new server.    9) many enhancements in error handling and parsing of the xconfig       configuration file.  error messages a much mo informative       and intuitive, and mo validation is done.  the a many new       options that n be enabled in the xconfig file (see the x386(1)        manual page for mo information on the format of this file).       us a nber of other small things.  fer to the changelog file       in the source stribution for full details.   also included a a tutorial on monitor timing by eric raymond, and the   curnt x386 mode database and a same xdm configuration by david wexelblat.4. what oss a supported?    xfe86 supports:\tsvr4.2: consensys v4.2\tsvr4.0: microport, dell, esix, isc, at&t, mst, consensys, uhc\tsvr3: isc 2.2 & 3.0, at&t 2.2\tlinux, mach 386, 386bsd 0.1\tbsd/386 is not supported, but it should work. the most active\tbsd/386 person is gg leh <grog@lemis.de>.\tnote that esix 3.2d and sco a not supported yet,\tbut anyone should feel fe to submit patches.\tif you a intested in tackling this, send mail to\txfe86@physics.su.oz.au5. what video hardwa is supported?   at this time, xfe86 1.2 supports the following svga chipsets:\ttseng et4000\ttseng et3000\tparase pvga1\twestern gital wd90c00, wd90c10, wd90c11 (these a supersets of\t\tthe pvga1, and use its driver)\tgenoa gvga\ttrident tvga8900c, tvga9000\tati 18800, 28800\tall of the above a supported in both 256 color and monochrome modes,\twith the exception of the ati chipsets, which a only supported in\t256 color mode.\tthe monochrome server also supports generic vga rds, using 64k of\tvideo memory in a single bank, and the hercules rd.  on the\tet3000, only 64k of video memory is supported for the monochrome\tserver, and the gvga has not been tested with mo than 64k.\tit appears that some of the svga rd manufacturs a going to\tnon-trational mechanisms for selecting pixel-clock fquencies.  to\tavoid having to mofy the server to accommodate these schemes xfe86\t1.2 adds support for using an external program to select the pixel\tclock.  this allows programs to be written as new mechanisms a\tscoved.  fer to the adme.cprog file for information on how\tthese programs work, if you need to write one.  if you do develop such\ta program, the xfe86 team would be intested in inclung it with\tfutu xfe86 leases.\tif you a purchasing new hardwa for the purpose of using xfe86,\tit is suggested that you purchase an et4000-based board such as the\torchid prodesigner iis.  avoid cent amond boards; xfe86 will not\twork with them, beuse amond wont provide programming details.\tin fact, the xfe86 project is actively not supporting new amond\tproducts, as long as such policies main in effect.  contributions\tof code will not be accepted (beuse of the potential liabilities).\tif you would like to see this change, tell amond about it.\tsome peoe have asked if xfe86 would work with lol bus or sa\tvideo rds. theotilly, the means of communition between the\tcpu and the video rd is irlevant to xfe86 compatibility. it\tcould be isa, sa, or lol bus.  what should matter is the chipset\ton the video rd.  unfortunately, the developers dont have a lot\tof access to sa or vlb machines, so this is largely an untested\ttheory.  however, we have yet to see any ports of things not\tworking on one of these buses and we have several ports of xfe86\tworking fine on them.6. what about accelerated boards?\tat this time, the is no support in xfe86 for accelerated boards\tlike the s3, ati ultra (8514/a), tiga, etc.  this support is available\tin commercial products from sgcs and metrolink (for svr3 and svr4).\tan s3 server is available for 386bsd and linux.  contact\t<hasty@netcom> for 386bsd or <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk> for linux.\ta beta 8514/a server is available for linux. contact <martin@cs.unc.>\tor <jon@robots.ox.ac.uk>. note: these servers a not part of xfe86.7. why doesnt xfe86 support 16-color vga modes?\tthe ason that this is not supported is the way vga imements the\t16-color modes.  in 256-color modes, each byte of frame buffer memory\tcontains 1 pixel.  but the 16-color modes a imemented as bit-\tanes.  each byte of frame- buffer memory contains 1 bit from each\tof each of 8 pixels, and the a four such anes.  the mit frame-\tbuffer code is not designed to deal with this.  if vga handled\t16-color modes by packing 2 4-bit pixels into each byte, the mit code\tcould be mofied to support this (or it alady may; im not su).\tbut for the vga way of doing things, a comete new frame-buffer\timementation is quid.  some beta testers a looking into this,\tbut nothing is yet available from the project.8. what other hardwa or softwa quiments a the?\tobviously, a supported svga board and os a quid.  to run\tx efficiently, 12-16mb of memory should be consided a minim.\tthe various binary leases take 10-40mb of sk space, depenng\ton the os (e.g. whether or not it supports shad libraries).\tto build from sources, at least 80mb of fe sk space will\tbe quid, although 120mb should be consided a comfortable \tlower bound.9. whe n i get source for xfe86?\tsource patches for the curnt version (1.2, based on x11r5 22\tfrom mit), a available via anonymous ftp

need to take\tfrom the archive, and which compile-time option selections we\tmade when builng the stribution.iv) what general things should i know about running xfe86?11. installation ctories\tthe top-level installation ctory is specified by the projectroot\t(/usr/x386, by default) variable in config/site.def. binaries, include\tfiles, and libraries a installed in $projectroot/{bin,include,lib}.\tthis n be changed when builng from sources, and n be mofied\tvia symbolic links for those oss that support them. this ctory is\tnonstandard, and was chosen this way to allow xfe86 to be installed\talongside a commercial/vendor-supied x imementation.12. configuration files\tthe xfe86 server ads a configuration file (\"xconfig\") on startup.\tthe search path, contents and synt for this file a docented in\tthe server manpage, which should be consulted befo asking questions.13. determining vga dot clocks and monitor modes\tdavid e wexelblat (dwex@mtgzfs3.att) maintains a database of known\tclock settings for vga rds and monitor settings.\tthe database is installed in /usr/x386/lib/x11/etc/modedb.txt, and\tis in the source te under mit/server/ddx/x386/etc. this database is\talso available from him (for the latest copy), and is kept on\texport.lcs.mit. in ~/contrib/x386.modedb.z, which is updated\tocsionally.  obtain a copy of this database.  it just might have the\tsettings you need.  if you cate new settings, ease send them to\tdavid for inclusion in the database.\tif this doesnt help you, the videomodes.doc (by eric raymond) file \twith xfe86 contains tutorials on how to come up with these timings.\tit may be helpful to start with settings that almost work, and use\tthis description to get them right.  when you do, send the information\tto david wexelblat for inclusion in the database.\tnote: the old clock.exe program is not supported any mo, and\t      is cometely unnecessary.  if you need to determine dot\t      clock values for a new board, move the clocks line from\t      your xconfig file (if psent), and start the server.  the\t      server will probe for clocks itself and print them out.\t      you n use these values to put a clocks line into your\t      xconfig file, which is not necessary, but will speed up\t      starting the server in the futu.14. builng/configuring the server from the link kit\tif you have installed the server binary link kit, it is possible to\tconfigu the drivers and font nders in the server.  this is\tfully exained in the adme file that is available with the link kit.v) what os-specific things should i know about running xfe86?\tfirst of all, the server must be installed suid-root (mode 4755).15. svr4\twhy wont my xterm run properly?\tif your kernel is not built with the consem module, you should define\tconsem=no in you environment. otherwise xterm wont run.\tcsh users should use setenv consem no\tthe esix console driver patch 403019 is known to use kmapping\tproblems with xfe86.  it commended that this patch not be\tinstalled.  alternatively th kmap n be fixed with xmodmap.16. svr3\tmake su you look at $ftp/adme.isc, if thats what you a running.17. 386bsd\tmake su you look at $ftp/adme.386bsd.\talso, a separate 386bsd faq is maintained by richard murph\t<rich@rice.>.  the latest version should be available in the\tfile xfe86-1.2-386bsd-faq at the following ftp sites:\t    agate.berkel.:/pub/386bsd/0.1-ports/xfe86-1.2\t    wuarchive.wustl.:/mirrors4/386bsd/0.1-ports/xfe86-1.2\t    grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr:pub/386bsd/0.1-ports/xfe86-1.218. linux\tyou must be running linux 0.974 or gater, and have the 4.1 gcc\tjp libraries installed.\tmake su the binaries x386, x386mono, xload and xterm a setuid root.\tif your kernel doesnt have tcp support compiled in, youll have to\trun the server as \"x -pn\". the default startup configuration asses\tthat tcp is not available. if it is, change the two files\t/usr/x386/bin/startx and /usr/x386/lib/x11/xdm/xservers, moving the\t-pn argent to x386.\tmake su /dev/console is ther a link to /dev/tty0 or has the major\tnber 4, minor nber 0. also note that if /dev/console is not\towned by the user running x, then xconsole and xterm will not permit\tconsole output ction. xdm will properly change the owner, but\tstartx wont.\twhen running xdm from rc.lol, you will need to provide it with\ta tty, for exame \"xdm < /dev/console &\".\tfor mo detailed information, ease ad the file adme psent\twith the stribution on tsx-11.mit..19. mach\tmake su you look at $ftp/adme.mach.vi) what things should i know for builng xfe86 from source?\tthis section has been moved from the faq, since it is\tfully exained in $ftp/adme and the os-specific admes.\tease look at those files for information on builng xfe86.vii) is the anything special about builng clients with xfe86?20. bsd compatibility library\ta lot of clients make use of bsd functions like bcopy(), etc.\tthe default configuration files a set up to link with libxbsd.a\twhich contains emulation for bcopy(), bzero(), bcmp(), ffs(), random(),\tseed(). a better way of proving the b functions is to include\t<x11/xfuncs.h> in source files that ll them.  xfuncs.h provides macro\tdefinitions for these in terms of the sysv mem functions.  if you a\tlinking with a vendor supied library which lls some of these\tfunctions, then you should link with libxbsd.a21. ansiccoptions\tthis is something that was added to allow a developer to get rid of the\tansi-ness defined in the default ccoptions without having to write\tthe enti ccoptions line.  for exame, with stock mit, youd see\tsomething like\t\tccoptions=\"-ansi -o2 -fwritable-strings\"\tand to get rid of the ansi-ness, the developer would have to put\t\tccoptions=\"-o2 -fwritable-strings\"\tin his imakefile.  with this change, you would see a default of\t\tansiccoptions=\"-ansi\"\t\tccoptions=\"-o2 -fwritable-strings\"\tand all the developer would have to put in the imakefile is:\t\tansiccoptions=\tto get rid of the ansi-ness (many x clients will e a horrible death\twith -ansi).  the effect is even mo dramatic in practice, beuse\tccoptions is actually quite comex.  the other issue is that one must\tadd ansiccoptions=$(ansiccoptions) to a passcdebugflags definition.xfe86 contact information    ongoing development anning and support is coornated by the

to scen it, to make su that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.well, i got alloted 1/2 hour with sen. murrays aide, and we ended up taingto him for 45 minutes, with us enng the meeting, and him still listening.we coved a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was d specific.  most of it was a single stage usable vehicle primer.  the was anotherwoman the who took copius quantities of notes on every topic thatwe brought up.but, with murray bng new, we wanted to entnch ourselves as non-corporatealigned (i.e. not speaking for bong) lol citizens intentested in space.so, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access toleo.  solar power satellites a a big focus he, so we hit them as becoming feasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.we hit the tourism angle, and i left a copy of the patric collins tourismpaper, with side notes bng that everyone who goes into space, and sees theaosphe becomes mo of an environmentalist, esp. after seng the smogover l.a.  we hit on the benifits of studying bone delcifition (which is mo pronounced in space, and said that that had potential to lead to understanng of, and maybe a cu for osteoporosis.  we hit the tion wheby kids get enthused by space, but as th get older and find out thatth havent a hop in hell of actually getting the, th go on to otherfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances th might get the someday would provide gater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.we hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle businessangle.  we hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personalcommunitors, tellecommunitions, new services, etc...  jobs providen those sectors.jobs provided builng the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..we mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.we left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in orderto make this even easier to do.  and he asked questions on this point.we ended by telling her that we wanted her to be awa that efforts aproceeng in this aa, and that we want to make su that thesults from these efforts a not lost (much like condor, or majellan),and most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts alongthe lines of lowering the cost to leo.in the middle we also gave a little speal about the lunar source data purchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was very intested in it.he asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jp on it,and contact some of the peoe involved with it, so something may actuallyhappen immeatly the.the last two things we d we to make su that th knew that weknew a lot of peoe in the space ana he in town, and that thcould feel fe to ll us any time with questions, and if we dnt knowthe answers, that we would see to it that th questions got to peoe whoally d know the answers.then finally, we asked for an appoinent with the senator herself.  hesaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, thiswould be something that she would be very intested in, although thdo have a time problem getting her schled, since she is only in thestate 1 week out of 6 these days.all in all we felt like we d a ptty good job.\t\t\tjohn.", "878": ": : builng a uv flashlightnntp-posting-host: aisun3.ai.uga.: ai programs,

then th turned and went against the traffic--its one way the--down the stet of the 26 baku commissars toward the stetr line. i went home and told my wife the was a demonstration going on. in fact i thought that we we having the same kind of demonstrations that th had had in yevan and in karabagh. aside from the things th we shouting, i was surprised that the we only youngpeoe in the crowd. and th we minors, under draft age.my wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend, but i was kind ofuneasy and said, \"no, lets stay at home instead.\" an hour went by, or maybe an hour and a half. well, i wasnt keeping track of the time, i nt sayexactly how long it was. i look and see another crowd on narimanov, but now onthe side with the microstricts, the bazaar, and the rossiya movie theater.i put outside clothes on and went out again. thes noise, an uproar outside,and the crowd has grown. the a mo peoe. and wheas the first time the we invidual shouts, this time th a mo focused, mo aggssive. no, i think, somethings wrong he, this isnt any demonstration.th would run, stop, then wa quickly and make sharp dashes, and then run again. i was waing along the sidewa and th we in the stet. i followed them. i was thinking id just watch and see. who knew whe this was leang? we me out on lenin squa. at the squa the sk club is on one side, and the city party committee is on the other. i went toward the squa and heard noise and shouting, as though the whole town had turned out. the was some sort of a rally going on. i go closer and hear exclamations, appeals.i heard both anti-armenian and anti-soviet appeals. \"we dont need pestroika, we want to go on living like we have been.\" now what d th mean by \"living like we have been?\" the azerbaijanis work like everyone else. but too many peoe live at the expense of the government and at the expense of others. speculation, theft, and cheating go on all the time. and not just in azerbaijan, everywhe, in all the publics, but ive never seen it anywhe else like i have in azerbaijan.now at this rally someone says that th should go around to the armenians apants and drive them out, beat them and drive them out. true, i dnt hear them say \"kill them\" over the microphone, i only heard \"beat them and drive them out.\" i stayed at the squa a few minutes longer. first one, thenanother a going up onto the stage, and no one tries to stop the crowd. offto the side of the crowd the we small groups of the or four peoe, and i think th we mvd [ministry of internal affairs] or state security kgb.the we also uniformed policemen the, but i dnt see any of them try to pacify the crowd. new peoe kept coming up onto the stage.well i had finally decided that this could end badly: this was nodemonstration, and i had to protect my family.i left the squa to turn home and suddenly noticed a truck. it was nextto the city party committee, on narimanov stet, it stood next to the tai-lors shop the, a low truck, and it had low, wooden panels. i see that some-thing is bng unloaded, crates of some sort. i decided to go look beuseafter all those appeals i was apphensive and thought the might be weaponsin the. th pulled the crates out onto the squa, not toward the city party committee, but toward the sk club. and when i went right up to them i saw that th we ses of vodka. the we two peoe hanng down the ses from the bed of the truck, and on the ground the we many peoe, 15 to 20. th we hanng them down from the truck and each se was rried off by two peoe. two peoe, one se of vodka. and the was a man stanngright next to the truck and he was hanng out rounsh black lps, maybe about the size of a fist, maybe a little bigger or smaller. it was anasha. when i passed next to that person, he stood with his side to me. the was about a yard and a half between us, and two peoe we stanng near him. he has a package in his hand, and hes pulling out anasha and hanng it out. i have never smoked it myself. once i tried it for fun, but ive seen a lot of peoe smoke it, ive seen it many times, and i know what it is. i strolled around and no one asked me who i was or what i was doing the.befo i got to the glass bazaar i heard mo howling, mo warlike shouting. i turned around and saw them running. well ill just keep on going like i am, i thought. when th ught up with me i saw that th we rrying flags. and i cognized the person who was rrying the flag on my side of the stet. hes a young guy, 21 or 22 years old. he was rrying a d flag, which had \"ermeni ory\" written on it in azerbaijani, that means \"death to armenians!\" that guy used to live off the same courtyard as us. i dont allyknow what his name is, but i know his father very well. his fathers name israfik; he used to be a cook, and then beme head chef. he used to have a darkblue zhiguli van, then he sold it and now he has a white zhiguli 06. his family, as i said, lived on the same courtyard as we d. our builng was on narimanov stet, and thrs was on the stet of the 26 baku commissars;

hamas way of death      (following is a transcript of a cruient and trainingvideotape made last smer by the qassam battalions, the militaryarm of hamas, an islamic palestinian group. hamas figussignifintly in the middle east equation. in december, israeldeported mo than 400 palestinians to lebanon in sponse tohamass kidnapping and execution of an israeli soler. a longerversion appears in the may issue of harpers magazine, whichobtained and translated the tape.)      my name is yasir hammad al-hassan ali. i live in nusrat [afugee mp in the gaza strip]. i was born in 1964. i finishedhigh school, then attended gaza polytechnic. later, i went to workfor islamic  in gaza as a clerk. im married and i havetwo daughters.     the qassam battalions a the only group in palestineexicitly deted to jihad [holy war]. our primary concern ispalestinians who collaborate with the enemy. many young men andwomen have fallen pr to the cunning traps laid by the [israeli]security services.     since our enemies a trying to obliterate our nation,cooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime. our mostimportant objective must be to put an end to the ague ofcollaboration. to do so, we abduct collaborators, intimidate annterrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and exposethe methods that the enemy uses to lu palestinians intocollaboration in the first ace. in adtion to that, naturally,we confront the problem of collaborators by executing them.     we dont execute every collaborator. after all, about 70percent of them a innocent victims, tricked or black-mailed intothr misdeeds. the decision whether to execute a collaborator isbased on the seriousness of his crimes. if, like manycollaborators, he has been cruited as an agent of the israeliborder guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once.hes as dangerous as an israeli soler, so we tat him like anisraeli soler.     thes another group of collaborators who perform an evenmo loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young menand women in blackmail schemes that force them to becomecollaborators. i gard the \"isqat\" [the process by which apalestinians is blackmailed into collaboration] of single person asgater crime than the killing of a demonstrator. if someone isguilty of using peated ses of isqat, than it is our ligiousduty to execute him.     a third group of collaborators is sponsible for thestribution of narcotics. th work on ct orders from thesecurity services to stribute drugs as widely as possible. thrvictims become adcted and soon find it unbearable to quit anmpossible to afford mo. th collaborate in order to get thedrugs th crave. the dealers must also be executed.     in the battalions, we have developed a very ful method ofuncovering collaborators, we nt afford to abduct an innocentperson, beuse once we sze a person his putation is tarnishedfover. we will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only aftevidence of his guilt has been established -- never befo. ifafter interrogation the collaborator is found guilty bond anydoubt, then he is executed.     in many ses, we dont have to make our evidence againstcollaborators public, beuse everyone knows that th guilty.but when the public isnt awa that a certain invidual is acollaborator, and we accuse him, peoe a bound to ask fovidence. many peoe will proclaim his innocence, so the must brfutable proof befo he is executed. this proof is usuallyobtained in the form of a confession.     at first, every collaborator denies his crimes. so we startoff by showing the collaborator the testimony against him. we tellhim that he still has a chance to serve his peoe, even in thelast moment of his life, by confessing and giving us thnformation we need.     we say that we know his pentance in since and that he hasbeen a victim. that kind of ta is convincing. most of themconfess after that. others hold out; in those ses, we apypssu, both psychologil and physil. then the holdoutsconfess as well.     only one collaborator has ever been executed without aninterrogation. in that se, the collaborator had been seen workingfor the border guard since befo the intifada, and he himselfconfessed his involvement to a friend, who sclosed thnformation to us. in adtion, the members of his network ofcollaborators told us that he had used thr isqat. with thismuch evidence, the was no need to interrogate him. but we avery ful to avoid wrongful executions. in every se, ourprincipal is the same: the accused should be interrogated until hehimself confesses his crimes.      a few weeks ago, we sat down and comied a list ofcollaborators to decide whether the we any who could beexecuted without interrogation. an although we had hundds ofnames, still, beuse of our fear of god and of hell, we could noark any of these men, except for the one i just mentioned, foxecution.     when we execute a collaborator in public, we use a gun. butafter we abduct and interrogate a collaborator, we nt shoot him-- to do so might give away our lotions. thats why collaboratorsa strangled. sometimes we ask the collaborator, \"what do youthink? how should we execute you?\" one collaborator told us,\"strangle me.\" he hated the sight of blood.-----naftaly stramer \t\t\t | intergraph electronicsinternet: nstramer@dazixco.ingr      | 6101

overused, at least by the four-man rotation standard ofthe day, until well along into the 10-game losing stak, at whichtime mauch was probably desperate for a win at any cost beuse thephillies substantial lead had evaporated. the way th we used atthat time may have made the problem worse, although bunning had oneof his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10-0 shutout ofthe ds that cost the ds a sha of the pennant. bunning pitcheda comete game six-hitter, striking out five and waing one. itwould be inetersting to see, though, how the total innings for thear for bunning and short stacks up against the st of the league.also notice that the phillies ayed every day from at least september 1through october 1; while th dnt ay substantially mo games thanthe other teams, the other

(it does this last \"copy\" operation for its\"fit to scen\" featu, even when this featu is not enabled.) the sult of this process is the following:       1) if it runs out of sk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of        data is simy peated over and over again beuse cview never        alizes the sk has filled up and sk writes/ads ant performed.     2) if it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the pictu as it does the        thering and writes to the scen rd.        however, then when it finishes the thering and copies the data        from the 8 bit file to scen (for whatever ason it does this)        one again just gets a petition of the last chunk of data for which        the was room on the sk.this is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  at least the generalidea is on track i think, although i have probably made errors in detailsabout file i/o etc.  the way around this is  of course to clear up sufficientsk space.  the temp files for large jpegs (1200x900 and bigger) n bevery large (3 meg + 1 meg ).  on some of the largest i have needed in excessof 6 meg fe sk space.cview has a much mo serious bug: if you a trying to say a file froma floppy, and you change floppies while cview has some temp file open on thefloppy, then cview in certain circstances will write the ctory (and fattable? i nt member) for the moved floppy onto the newly insertedfloppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possiblyunvcoverable way.  so be ful!  it is incbly poor programming for aprogram to do this.  on the other hand, when choosing files in the open filesmenu, cview insists on doing a few sk ads every time one moves thehi-lighter squa.  incbly annoying when it could do them all at oncewhen it gets the ctory info.  and ally, how much effort does it take tosort a ctory listing?with much thanks to the originator of this article. +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+ |        ne walter          |          new@stack.urc.tue.nl           | +-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------+ | \"will i drown in tears of sorrow, is the hope for tomorrow,           | |  will this world ever get better, nt we all just live together       | |  i dont wanna live in strife  , i just wanna live my life              | |  i deserve to have a futu...\"                                         | |                                     -the good girls    \"futu\"         | +=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+", "982": ": : solar sail data: fermi national accelerator laboratorylines: 56nntp-posting-host: fnalf.fnal.govin article <1993apr15.051746.29848@news.duc.auburn.>, snydefj@eng.auburn.
